Introduction: </b></p><p>Disasters and emergencies are fundamental reflections of normal life. They are consequences of the way society structure themselves, economically and socially; the way societies and states interact; and the way that relationships between the decision makers are sustained. The disaster emanates from the fact that certain communities or groups are forced to settle in areas susceptible to the impact of ranging river or a volcanic eruption. The magnitude of each disaster, be in terms of deaths, property damage or costs for a given developing country increases with the increment of marginalization of the population. As the population increases, the best land in both rural and urban areas is taken up, and those seeking land for farming or housing are forced to accept inadequate land. These offer less productivity and a smaller measure of physical or economic safety. </p><p>Disasters have massive human and economic costs. They may cause many deaths, severe injuries, and food shortages. Most incidents of severe injuries and deaths occur during the time of impact, whereas disease outbreaks and food shortages often arise much later, depending on the nature and duration of the disaster. Anticipating the potential consequences of disasters can help determine the actions that need to be started before the disaster strikes to minimize its effects. This Chapter deals with definitions of disaster and other related terms like hazard, vulnerability and prevention. Moreover it also addresses types of disaster and discusses the trends of the occurrence of disasters to introduce readers the basic concepts of the subject matter. </p><p><b>1.2. Definitions</b>: </p><p><b>Disaster:</b> several definitions are frequently given to disaster. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a disaster as "a sudden ecological phenomenon of sufficient magnitude to require external assistance". It is also defined as any event, typically occurring suddenly, that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services, and which exceeds the capacity of the affected community on a scale sufficient to require outside assistance (Landsman, 2001). It is an emergency of such severity and magnitude that the resultant combination of deaths, injuries, illness, and property damage cannot be effectively managed with routine procedures or resources.<b> </b></p><p>Disaster is further defined as an event in which a society or a community undergoes acute deprivation of food and other basic necessities due to natural and man made calamities to such an extent that the normal function of the society or the community is disrupted and that it cannot subsist without outside intervention (13). </p><p><b>Emergency </b>is a state in which normal procedures are suspended and extra-ordinary measures are taken in order to avert a disaster. An emergency can be defined in the context of the social, political and epidemiological circumstances in which it occurs. </p><p><b>Hazard</b> is a rare or extreme event in the natural or human made environment that adversely affects human life, property or activity to the extent of causing a disaster. It is essential to make a distinction between hazards and disasters, and to recognize that the effect of the former upon the latter is essentially a measure of the society\'s vulnerability. </p><p> (12) </p><p><b>Mitigation:</b> is permanent reduction of the risk of a disaster. Primary mitigation refers to reducing the resistance of the hazard and reducing vulnerability. Secondary mitigation refers to reducing the effects of the hazard (preparedness). </p><p>Mitigation includes recognizing that disasters will occur; attempts are made to reduce the harmful effects of a disaster, and to limit their impact on human suffering and economic assets. </p><p><b>Prevention</b> is defined as those activities taken to prevent a natural phenomenon or potential hazard from having harmful effects on either people or economic assets. Delayed actions drain the economy and the resources for emergency response within a region. For developing nations, prevention is perhaps the most critical components in managing disasters, however, it is clearly one of the most difficult to promote. Prevention planning is based on two issues: hazard identification (identifying the actual threats facing a community) and vulnerability assessment (evaluating the risk and capacity of a community to handle the consequences of the disaster). Once these issues put in order of priority, emergency managers can determine the appropriate prevention strategies. </p><p>Disaster prevention refers to measures taken to eliminate the root-causes that make people vulnerable to disaster (13). </p><p><b>Preparedness: </b>Are the measures that ensure the organized mobilization of personnel, funds, equipments, and supplies within a safe environment for effective relief. </p><p>Disaster preparedness is building up of capacities before a disaster situation prevails inorder to reduce impacts. Its measures include inter alia, availability of food reserve, emergency reserve fund, seed reserve, health facilities, warning systems, logistical infrastructure, relief manual, and shelves of projects (13). </p><p><b>Reconstruction</b>: the full resumption of socio-economic activities plus preventive measures. </p><p><b>Rehabilitation</b>: is the restoration of basic social functions. </p><p><b>Resilience: </b>is adaptability, capacity to recover. </p><p><b>Response</b>: is the set of activities implemented after the impact of a disaster in order to assess the needs, reduce the suffering, limit the spread and the consequences of the disaster, open the way to rehabilitation. </p><p><b>Risk </b>is the expected losses (lives lost, persons injured, damages to property and disruption of economic activity) due to a particular hazard. Risk is the product of hazard and vulnerability. </p><p>Risk is the probability that a person will experience an event in a specified period of time. Risk as a function of hazard and vulnerability, a relationship that is frequently illustrated with the following formula, although the association is not strictly arthematic: Risk = hazard x vulnerability. </p><p>Risk is the probability of being affected by the unwanted consequences of a hazard. It combines the level of hazard and degree of vulnerability. </p><p><b>Risk assessment </b>is a term used widely for a systematic approach to characterizing the risks posed to individuals and populations by potentially adverse exposures.<b> </b></p><p><b>Susceptibility: </b>is exposure to danger. </p><p><b>Vulnerability:</b> is the degree of loss resulting from a potentially damaging phenomenon. </p><p> It is the susceptibility of a population to specific type of event. Vulnerability is also associated with the degree of possible or potential loss from a risk that results from a hazard at a given intensity. The factors that influence intensity include demographics, the age, and resilience of the environment, technology, social differentiation and diversity as well as regional and global economics and politics. </p><p>It is essential to make distinction between hazard and disaster. The presence of hazard by its self can neither cause risk nor disasters. There are different predisposing factors that make vulnerable the survivors. The following are some of such underlying causes: </p><p>• Poverty: Virtually all disaster studies show that the wealthiest of the population survive the disaster, remains unaffected or are able to recover quickly. </p><p>• Population growth: Increasing number of people will compete for limited amount of resources which can lead to conflict and conflict may result in crisis-induced migration. </p><p>• Rapid urbanization: competition for scarce resources is an inevitable consequence of rapid urbanization, leading to human-made disasters. </p><p>• Transitions in cultural practices: Societies are constantly changing and in continuous state of transition. These transitions are often extremely disruptive and uneven, leaving gaps in social coping mechanisms and technology. Conflicts as well as transitional cultural practices can also lead to civil conflict (e.g. communal violence triggered by religious differences). </p><p>• Environmental degradation: Deforestation leads to rapid rain run off, which contributes to flooding. </p><p>• Lack of awareness and information: Disasters can also happen because people vulnerable to them simply do not know how to get out of harm\'s way or to take protective measures. </p><p>• Wars and civil strife are among the principal man made factors precipitating disaster. </p><p>Disaster mainly occurs when vulnerability and hazard meet. The interaction and association of such phenomena is depicted in the following figure (Figure 1). </p><p><b>Figure1: Relationship of vulnerability, hazard and disaster </b></p><p><b>Source: WHO/EHA, 2002 </b></p><p><b>1.3. TYPES OF DISASTERS </b></p><p>Disasters are broadly divided into two types comprising natural and man made (technological) disasters. There is also other basis by which disasters can be categorized which has been mentioned later in this section. </p><p><b>1.3.1. Natural disasters</b> </p><p>Natural disasters occur as the <b>result of action of the natural forces</b> and tend to be accepted as unfortunate, but inevitable. The natural disasters result from forces of <b>climate </b>and <b>geology</b>. Natural disasters are perhaps the most "unexpected" and costly overall in terms of loss of human lives and resources. In the last few years, natural disasters have claimed 100,000 lives costing above 140 billion US dollars. </p><p>During the 1980s, more than 700,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of severe weather, including floods and droughts. Natural disasters can be categorized as "acute" or "slow" in their onset. They should be predictable in certain instances since they cluster in geographical areas. Natural disasters with acute onsets include events such as earthquake, flood, hurricane, cyclone or typhoon, tornado, fire, tsunami or storm surge, avalanche, volcanic eruption, extreme cold or blizzard, and heat wave. Natural hazards with slow or gradual onset include drought, famine, desertification, deforestation, and pest infestation. </p><p>The 1990s and beyond proved to be even more calamitous, as global natural disaster trends rose with increasing rapidity (Figure 2). Among the different types of natural disasters, floods, tropical storms, droughts and earth-quakes are the most destructive, followed by landslides and storms. </p><p> Source: Emergency Disasters Data Base, EM-DAT. (http://www.em-dat.net/) </p><p>Figure 2: Global trends of natural disasters. </p><p>In 1992 alone, natural disasters costed the world economy more money than it spent on development aid. The November 2004 typhoons in the Philippines also claimed over 1,000 lives and devastated the livelihoods of many more. The recent Indian Ocean Tsunami was even more destructive that more than 150,000 lives were lost. As reported by the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), the last ten years have seen 478,100 people killed, more than 2.5 billion people affected and about US$ 690 billion in economic losses. Disasters triggered by hydrometeorological hazards amounted for 97 percent of the total people affected by disasters, and 60 percent of the total economic losses (30).The damage and costs inflicted by natural disasters spread well beyond the immediate regions affected, to countries as a whole and often to the wider global community. </p><p>The incidence of hazards demonstrates considerable geographic variation. During the period 1994-2003, Asia was disproportionately affected by natural disasters (Figure 3). Approximately half of the 650 natural catastrophes recorded in 2004 were windstorms and severe weather events, while 80 were due to geological hazards (70 damaging earthquakes and 10 volcanic eruptions). As a result of increasingly effective preventive measures, while the number of disasters has more than tripled since the 1970s, the reported death toll has almost been reduced by half. </p><p>Source: Emergency Disasters Data Base, EM-DAT. (http://www.em-dat.net/) </p><p> Figure 3: Distribution of natural disasters by Region </p><p>Around 75 percent of the world\'s population lives in areas affected at least once by earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or drought between 1980 and 2000. Billions of people in more than 100 countries are periodically exposed to at least one event of earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or drought. As a result of disasters triggered by these natural hazards, more than 184 deaths per day are recorded in different parts of the world, 11 percent of the people exposed to natural hazards live in countries classified as having low human development, and they account for more than 53 percent of total recorded deaths7. For each hazard type, disaster risk is considerably lower in high-income countries than in medium- and low-income countries. </p><p>Figure 4: Economic losses due to natural disasters 1960-2000 (million US$) </p><p>Natural disasters can have significant economic and food security impacts, especially on the poorest households. In the last three decades, there has been a clear increase in the number of natural hazard events, the size of affected populations and the extent of economic losses (Figure 4). Several million victims have suffered homelessness, disaster induced ill health, severe economic losses and personal tragedies. </p><p>Direct economic losses increased five times in the 1990s (Figure 4) and are mostly concentrated in the developed countries. Underlying these economic figures is not only the destruction of productive assets and vital infrastructure and the loss of livelihood systems but also their implication to economic development and poverty aggravation. When disasters occur, poor households suffer greater relative losses in terms of physical and social assets, resulting in deepening their poverty further. Such losses of assets can trap households in chronic poverty and food insecurity. </p><p>An important development in disaster management approaches over the past decade has been the recognition of their cyclical nature. Although the response phase captures most of the attention, much of the hard work on disaster risk management is carried out before disasters occur, in the form of risk assessment, prevention, mitigation, and establishing early warning systems. After the crisis has passed, the emphasis is on rehabilitation, reconstruction, and the commencement of a new cycle of assessment, incorporating lessons derived from the previous cycle. </p><p><b>1.3.2. Human (technological) causes </b> </p><p>The technological or manmade disasters result from some human activities, such as explosions, fires, the release of toxic chemicals or radioactive materials, bridge or building collapse, crashes, dam or levee failure, nuclear reactor accidents, breaks in water, gas, or sewer lines, deforestation, war, etc. Technological disasters tend to involve many more casualties than natural disasters of the same magnitude of energy release. </p><p>Technological or man-made disasters are unpredictable, can spread across geographical areas, may be unpreventable and may have limited physical damage but long-term effect. They are also much more difficult for the community to deal with and for victims to accept. In technological disasters, there are issues of blame involved and the community spends much time discussing who was responsible and what mistakes were made. Increasingly, agencies involved in disasters and their management are concerned with the interactions between man and nature, which can be complex and can aggravate disasters. </p><p>Communities in which industrial sites are located or through which hazardous material pass via high way, rail, or pipeline are at risk for technological disasters. Injuries can occur to workers at the site, to responders bringing the incident under control and providing emergency medical care, and to residents in the community. Those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as lung or heart diseases, could be at increased risk for negative health outcomes if exposed to toxic related skin disorders, and lung damage can result from exposure to specific agents. </p><p>Ensuring that local industry implements basic safety procedures can significantly reduce negative health outcome from accidental release of toxins. Emergency preparedness - including the ability of pre-\nhospital and hospital systems to care for patients exposed to industrial agents, the training of medical personnel to work in contaminated environments, and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment for responders - is key for providing care following industrial accidents. </p><p><b>Another classification of disasters will be as follows: </b></p><p>1. <b>Sudden-onset disasters </b>include floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, or tidal waves, tropical storms, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. As their name implies, sudden-onset disasters occur swiftly and often without any warning. Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster associated with sudden migration of large populations and food shortages. Other types of disasters generally occur more frequently in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean rather than in Africa. When these disasters occur, they frequently cause thousands of deaths and casualties. Earthquakes cause the greatest number of deaths and overwhelming infrastructural damage. Communities at risk of these types of disasters should recognize and respond to threats posed by local weather patterns and the shape and contours of the land. </p><p>2. <b>Slow-onset disasters </b>include droughts, famine, environmental degradation, deforestation (loss of trees and vegetation), pest infestation and desertification (conversion of arable lands to deserts). These disasters are usually the result of adverse weather conditions combined with poor land use. Traditionally, African communities, particularly the poor, have been at increased risk of these types of disasters because of poverty and social inequality, environmental degradation from poor land use and rapid population growth. Slow-onset disasters can be prevented because they happen over a long period of time and human decisions contribute to (or cause) problems. Early warning systems can be easily put in place to lessen or even prevent the disaster. </p><p>3. <b>Industrial/technological disasters </b>result from a society\'s industrial and technological activities that lead to pollution, spillage, explosions, and fires. They may occur because of poor planning and construction of manmade facilities (buildings, factories, etc.) or from neglect of safety procedures. Sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and terrorist acts may trigger secondary disasters such as fires or pollution. Industrial events have the potential to cause large-scale loss of life and infrastructural damage, especially in developing countries with unregulated industrialization, and inadequate safety standards and disaster response capacity. Wherever there is a man-made facility, there is the potential for an industrial or technological disaster to occur. Reducing the occurrence and effects of industrial disasters requires a multi-sectoral approach. </p><p>4. <b>Complex emergencies </b>are usually man-made, with multiple contributing factors. They often follow wars between states, internal conflict, and, increasingly, terrorist acts. Massive population displacements may occur due to lack of food, insecurity, and increasing death rates. Poverty and risk of conflict go hand in hand. Civilians that are not part of the conflicts end up bearing the majority of casualties because they are often targets of both sides of the conflict. </p><p>5. <b>Epidemic diseases </b>are those diseases that normally do not occur in stable communities but have the potential to spread under certain conditions. This can cause frequent and severe outbreaks. These diseases may be spread by contaminated water or food, person-to-person contact, or through animals or insect vectors. Examples of epidemic diseases that commonly threaten displaced populations include cholera, measles, dysentery, respiratory infections, malaria, and, increasingly, HIV. After a major disaster, the risk of epidemic diseases increases mainly as a result of overcrowding and unhygienic conditions </p><p><b>1.4. Phases of Disasters: </b></p><p>Disaster situations are dynamic, always changing and demanding a change in response. Disasters can be viewed as a series of phases on a time continuum. Even though the evolving situation may appear continuous, identifying and understanding these phases helps to describe related needs and to conceptualize appropriate disaster management activities. These phases are described below: </p><p><b>1. Pre-emergency phase</b>: the period before the disaster strikes may be used to assess how often a particular community is exposed to different risks (risk mapping) and how good is their preparedness. Protective actions can be undertaken based on the disaster warning and the available resources, e.g. identifying temporary shelters, stocking basic supplies, planning evacuation routes, monitoring trends, etc. </p><p><b>2. Impact and flight phase</b>: when a disaster strikes the hazard (fire, earthquake, floods, conflicts, etc) may trigger the displacement of large number of people from their homes. How long this phase lasts depends on the type of disaster, the number people affected and the distance they must travel to find sanctuary. Search and rescue and other assistances, e.g. providing transportation, shelter and basic supplies to affected people may be carried out to reduce the loss of lives. </p><p><b>3. Acute phase</b>: this phase begins immediately after the impact of the disaster and marked by intense, often reactive activities by many humanitarian agencies responding to media reports of very high death rate (may be 5-60 times the normal death rate). The priority is to keep the affected people alive. Security may be a major concern in complex emergency situations. Critical services such as providing food, water, sanitation, basic health care, protection from violence and harassment are to be quickly organized. This phase ends when crude death rate falls below 1/10,000 persons per day (the crude mortality rate for stable population in Africa is about 0.5/10,000 individual per day). </p><p><b>4</b>. P<b>ost emergency phase</b>: the population movement usually slows down. This enables critical services to be properly established and maintained. During this phase the cause of displacement may be evolving. The displaced people wait for "something to happen" so that they can return home, integrate with the local community or relocate else where. As international support declines, the emphasis shifts to building local capacity of and promoting community participation. Tracing reproductive health care, mental health care and other services may be initiated, based on the epidemiological information. It is difficult to set time limits on the post-disaster time phases or to accurately define the limits of each, even for one specific type of disaster. For example, the emergency phase of a hurricane or a flood may be only a few days, or as long as a week. A drought and a resulting famine can last for months or even a year or more. </p><p><b>5. Repatriation phase</b>: after the emergency situation is over, displaced people are expected to return to their place of origin either on their own or with the help of relief agencies. Repatriation may be either forced or voluntary. </p><p><b>6. Rehabilitation or reconstruction phase</b>: once permanent solution is obtained, the focus shifts from relief to development. The aim is to help the affected community become self-reliant. The responsibility of providing assistance is handed over to the affected community, the local authorities, development agencies and other non-governmental organizations. Because humanitarian and development technicians have different approaches to providing assistance and the infrastructure for relief is inadequate for development, the programs are re-oriented and redesigned. </p><p><b>Exercise</b>: </p><p>1. How do you define disaster? </p><p>2. List and describe phases of disasters. </p><p>3. What are the types of disaster? Describe them. 4. Why do trends of disasters increase over time? </p><h3><p>CHAPTER TWO FACTORS LEADING TO DISASTERS </p><p>Learning objectives: </p></h3><p>At the end of the chapter the students are expected to: </p><p>• Describe causes and consequences of deforestation. </p><p>• Mention predisposing factors for droughts. </p><p>• Identify impacts of droughts. </p><p>• Describe the need for climatic change adaptation with respect to disasters. </p><p>• Describe impacts of floods and public health interventions to reduce health effects. </p><p>• Mention major causes of air pollutions. </p><p>• Describe causes and impacts of global warming. </p><p>• Mention the causes, impacts and public intervention of fires and explosions. </p><p><b>2.1 Introduction </b></p><p>There are numerous factors that trigger the occurrence of disasters ranging from natural to man made predisposing factors. It is beyond the scope of this lecture note to discuss all. Hence this chapter deals with some prominent factors that lead to disasters. This chapter is organized in such away that it imparts readers the magnitudes, impacts and, where possible, the management (prevention and control) of these disaster causing factors. </p><p><b>2.2. Deforestation </b></p><p><b>Definition</b>: Deforestation is the removal or damage of vegetation in a forest to the extent that it no longer supports its natural flora and fauna. It is most frequently caused by humans taking care of their immediate needs, while not being aware of the long-term effects of their actions. </p><p><b>Magnitude</b>: The rapid rate of deforestation in the tropics is a key driving force in the yearly increase of flood disasters. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization and United Nations Environmental Program (FAO/UNEP) study in 1981, tropical forests are disappearing at the rate of <b>7.3 million hectares </b>(18 million acres) <b>per year</b>: </p><p>• 4.2 million hectares (10.4 million acres) a year in Latin America </p><p>• 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) a year in Asia </p><p>• 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) a year in Africa. </p><p><b>Impacts </b></p><p>The greatest and most immediate danger of deforestation is that gradually diminishing forested areas contribute to or worsen other disasters. For example, by removing vegetation that retains water, deforestation can lead to <b>flooding, drought</b> and <b>desertification</b>. By removing vegetation that stabilizes the soil, desertification can lead to erosion, siltation and an increased chance of landslides during earthquakes. </p><p><i>Impact on Agriculture and Ecology</i><i> </i></p><p>Deforestation\'s impact on food supply follows this chain of events: </p><p>1. Deforestation 2. Erosion </p><p>3. Collapse of hillsides </p><p>4. Loss of topsoil and agricultural land. </p><p>5. Reduced productivity which leads to food insecurity. </p><p><b>Impact on Economy</b><b> </b></p><p>What are the economic consequences of uncontrolled deforestation and forest-product scarcity? </p><p>• Rising dependence on imported forest products. Already most of the Third World countries are net importers of forest products, particularly paper. </p><p>• Foreign exchange shortages and high prices can hold a nation\'s wood and paper consumption well below the levels at which basic needs are satisfied. </p><p>• Acute scarcities of firewood and timber plague wide areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. </p><p>• Soaring firewood prices are also another inflation source. In parts of West Africa and Central America, urban families spend one-fourth of their income on wood or charcoal for cooking. </p><p>Deforestation and timber scarcity have an especially harmful impact on housing in poor countries. Even if Third World governments were to make a serious effort to meet the housing problem, adequate wood supplies would not be available in many cases. For example, in the late 1970s, the Indian state of Gujarat conceived of an ambitious plan to construct huts for landless laborers. The plan was derailed by the lack of raw materials. The program called for 25 million wood poles, but only 400,000 of those became available each year; and only four million bamboo stalks were produced a year, although 765 million were needed. </p><p><b>Management </b></p><p>But essential as they are, forestry measures alone will not be enough to solve the deforestation problem. Many of the underlying sources of deforestation originate outside the scope of forestry per se. In order to halt the destructive spread of cultivation, national development patterns must provide the destroyers with alternative ways to feed themselves; in particular, crop yields and employment must be boosted on the lands best suited to farming. <b>Sound forestry policies</b> can contribute to these efforts, but broader decisions on investment priorities, land tenure, and the choice of technologies will be even more critical. Woodland depletion by firewood gatherers can be greatly mitigated by tree planting, but broader <b>attention to rural energy needs, alternative energy sources</b>, and <b>national energy priorities</b> is also necessary. Of course, human population growth underlies all the sources of deforestation. A vast amount of tree planting is essential over the coming decades, but its benefits will be undercut if the deeper roots of deforestation are not eradicated. Deforestation also unbalances the water supply by contributing to drought and flood.<b> </b></p><p><b>2.3. Drought and famine </b></p><p><b>Drought</b> is defined as a water shortage caused by deficiency of rainfall and differs from other natural hazards in three ways: </p><p><b>Drought</b> is lack or insufficiency of rain for an extended period that severely disturbs the hydrologic cycle in an area. Droughts involve water shortages, crop damage, stream flow reduction, and depletion of groundwater and soil moisture. They occur when evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation for a considerable period. Drought is the most serious hazard to agriculture in nearly every part of the world. Efforts have been made to control it by seeding clouds to induce rainfall, but these experiments have had only limited success. </p><p>A <b>famine</b> is a phenomenon in which a large percentage of the populations of a region or country are so undernourished and that death by starvation becomes increasingly common. In spite of the much greater technological and economic resources of the modern world, famine still strikes many parts of the world, mostly in the developing nations. Famine is associated with naturally-occurring crop failure and pestilence and artificially with war and genocide </p><p>• Drought has long been recognized as one of the most insidious causes of human misery. </p><p>• It has today the unfortunate distinction of being the natural disaster that annually claims most victims. </p><p>• Its ability to cause widespread misery is actually increasing. </p><p>While generally associated with semiarid climates, drought can occur in areas that normally enjoy adequate rainfall and moisture levels. In the broadest sense, any lack of water for the normal needs of agriculture, livestock, industry, or human population may be termed a drought. The cause may be lack of supply, contamination of supply, inadequate storage or conveyance facilities, or abnormal demand. Drought is usually accompanied by hot, dry winds and may be followed by damaging floods. </p><p><b>Geographical Distribution</b><b> </b></p><p>Droughts occur in all of the world\'s continents. In recent decades, the most severe and devastating to human populations have been in Africa, perhaps giving the impression that droughts are principally an African problem. In fact, devastating droughts have occurred in virtually all of the major semiarid regions of the world as well as in many zones that are normally temperate climates with significant annual rainfalls. </p><p>In addition to the droughts in the African Sahel, there have recently been major droughts in northeast Brazil, Chile, Ethiopia, the Philippines, the Bolivian altiplano, and India. Near-drought conditions in the grain-producing regions of the United States and the Soviet Union have also occurred, affecting greatly the international food supply and demand. </p><p>Trends in the occurrence of droughts indicate that they are becoming more frequent on the edges of desert lands and where agricultural, lumbering, and livestock grazing practices are changing. </p><p><b>Natural Preconditions for Drought Disasters</b><b> </b></p><p>Drought differs from other natural disasters in its slowness of onset and its commonly lengthy duration. Before the rise of modern water-consuming cities, drought was an agricultural disaster. Now, with cities having expanded faster than water supplies can be made available, the specter of drought faces both the farmer and the urban dweller. Shifts in atmospheric circulation, which cause drought, may extend for time scales of a month, a season, several years or even a century. The following are conditions that lead to drought: </p><p>• Widespread and persistent <b>atmospheric calm areas known as subsidence</b>, which do not cause precipitation. These areas result from the present-day atmospheric circulation, which tends to create subsidence in the subtropical latitudes of both hemispheres. </p><p>• <b>Localized subsidence induced by mountain barriers</b> or other physiographic features. Most such areas lie in the lee of mountains across the westerly belts. They are hence in midlatitudes. The dryness is caused by the warming of westerly currents as they descend east of the summits. This allows them to hold moisture and carry it away. </p><p>• <b>Absence of rainmaking disturbances</b> causes dry weather even in areas of moist air. In general, rain is caused by the travel of organized disturbances across a region--i.e., systems that involve actual uplift of humid air. There is plenty of water in the air, but nothing to bring it down as rain. </p><p>• <b>Absence of humid airstreams</b>. The relationship between the water available for precipitation (precipitable water) and the precipitation that actually falls is by no means simple. </p><p>The above four predisposing factors are interdependent, but their relative effect depends on season and locality. One can broadly distinguish between: </p><p>1. Almost continuously dry climates, leading to desert surface conditions, in which there is no season of appreciable rainfall; </p><p>2. Semiarid or sub-humid climates with a short wet season in which humid airstreams or rainmaking disturbances penetrate; </p><p>3. The rare sub-humid areas in which rainfall is infrequent but not confined to a special season. </p><p>Human activities also contribute to the development of drought conditions. Overgrazing, poor cropping methods and improper soil conservation techniques often contribute to creating drought. </p><p><b>Recurrence Interval</b><b> </b></p><p>Climatologists debate whether drought is a short-term aberration in the climate or the result of long-term climatic changes. Some argue that drought feeds upon itself; that as vegetation is stripped from the land; the surface dries out and reflects more of the sun\'s heat. This would alter the thermal dynamics of the atmosphere and suppress rainfall, which would, in turn, dry out more land. </p><p>Historically, droughts have tended to occur at regular intervals. Whether precisely predictable or not, the historical trends can give an indication as to when drought periods might be expected. For this reason, it is important that persons living in marginal or semiarid areas try to learn about the history of drought in that particular region and use this knowledge as a rule of thumb in predicting future drought periods. </p><p><b>Impact of Droughts on Built and Natural Environments</b><b> </b></p><p><b>Primary (Immediate) Effects</b><b> </b></p><p>• Water supplies are overtaxed and finally dry up </p><p>• Loss of crops </p><p>• Loss of livestock and other animals, and </p><p>• Loss of water for hygienic use and drinking. </p><p><b>Secondary (Resulting) Effects of Drought</b><b> </b></p><p>• Migration in search of better grazing lands </p><p>• Famine </p><p>• Permanent changes of settlement, social, and living patterns. </p><p>• Major ecological changes (scrub growth, flash flooding and increased wind erosion of soils) </p><p>• Desertification. </p><p><b>The Impact of Droughts on Development</b><b> </b></p><p>If a drought is allowed to continue without response, the impact on development can be severe. <b>Food shortages</b> may become chronic. The country <b>urban growth may be accelerated due to migration of people from rural areas.</b> To respond to this, the government must borrow heavily and must divert money from other development schemes in order to meet these needs. All serve to undermine the potential for economic development. </p><p>If drought response is treated as only a relief operation, it may wipe out years of development work, especially in rural areas. </p><p><b>Agricultural projects in particular are most likely to be affected by droughts</b>. A balanced agricultural program that develops good water resources, addresses the problems of soil erosion, adopts realistic limits on the expansion of animal herds, or accompanies herd expansion with comprehensive range management will contribute to the mitigation of drought impact. </p><p>The same philosophy is used for reconstruction in the aftermath of a drought. <b>Reconstruction</b> should be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate development work. It is an ideal time to introduce improved animal husbandry techniques, rangeland management, water resource development schemes and erosion control measures. </p><p><b>Relief Operations for Famine and Food Emergencies</b><b> </b></p><p>The primary purpose of relief operations during famine is to provide food to inhibit the occurrence of malnutrition. The nutrition component of relief operations in times of famine and food emergency may be divided into two broad groups of interrelated activities dealing with <b>general food rations</b> and <b>selective feeding programs</b>. Often the provision of food assistance to disaster victims is accompanied by public health programs, particularly immunization campaigns and primary health care services. </p><p><b>General food rations:</b> involves the complex interaction of nutritional planning, agency appeal and procurement, donor pledging, international shipping, national logistics, warehousing, inventory and distribution. </p><p><b>Selective feeding programs:</b> The purposes of selective feeding programs are to <b>provide complete protection to population groups with increased vulnerability</b> to nutritional deficiencies and to recuperate those already suffering from malnutrition. Selective feeding programs for disaster victims are usually divided into two distinct operations. Supplementary feeding programs are designed to protect vulnerable groups against malnutrition and to rehabilitate those individuals currently suffering from moderate protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). </p><p>Intensive feeding programs (also called <b>therapeutic feeding</b>) are curative operations designed to reduce mortality among cases of severe PEM. </p><p><i> </i></p><p>Figure 5 African Countries facing food emergency, 1996 Map <i> </i></p><p><b>Public health interventions </b></p><p>• Monitor health and nutritional status by assessing using anthropometric measurements; </p><p>• Monitor death rate; </p><p>• Ensure safe water, sanitation, and disease control. </p><p>• Assess and ensure food safety and security, including availability, accessibility, and consumption pattern; </p><p><b>2.4. Epidemic </b> </p><p><b>Definition: </b></p><p><b>An epidemic </b>is<b> </b>the occurrence of a number of cases of a disease in excess of the usual occurrence for a given place and time. </p><p><b>A threatened (or potential) epidemic</b> is said to exist when the circumstances are such that the epidemic occurrence of a specific disease may reasonably be anticipated. </p><p>The spread of infectious disease depends upon preexisting levels of the disease, ecological changes resulting from disaster, population displacement, and changes in the density of population, disruption of public utilities, interruption of basic public health services, compromising the sanitation and hygiene. <b>The probability that epidemics of infectious diseases will occur</b> is proportional to <b>the population density and displacement.</b> An epidemic can occur in susceptible populations in the presence or impeding introduction of a disease agent compounded by the presence of a mechanism that facilitates large-scale transmission (For example, Contamination of water supply or increment of vector population). </p><p>In general, many natural and/or man made disasters that affect or disrupt one or more parts of the public health infrastructure, including the sanitation systems, potable water supplies, nutrition stores, primary health care access (including routine immunization program), vector control programs, and established systematic surveillance mechanisms, can trigger infectious disease outbreaks. </p><p><b>Impact: </b></p><p>Displaced populations suffer high rate of disease due to stress of migration, crowding, and unsanitary conditions of relocation sites. Morbidity and mortality can result from diarrheal diseases, respiratory diseases, and malnutrition. Mortality exceeding a baseline of <b>one death per 10,000 people per day</b> is the index of concern.<b> </b></p><p>The public health importance of an epidemic disease results from the number of persons at risk, risk of fatal cases or sequelae, speed of spread, disruption of social life and economic losses, possible contamination of water supply, food chains, local animal reservoirs and vectors, the risk of new epidemic situation and difficulty and cost associated with prevention and control. </p><p>Quick response is essential because epidemics, which result in human and economic losses and political difficulties, often rise rapidly. An epidemic or threatened epidemic can become an emergency when the following characteristics of the events are present. Not all of the characteristics need to be present and each must be assessed with regard to relative importance equally: </p><p>• Risk of introduction to and spread of the disease in the population; </p><p>• Large number of cases may reasonably be expected to occur ; </p><p>• Disease involved is of such severity as to lead to serious disability or death; </p><p>• Risk of social or economic disruption resulting from the presence of the disease; </p><p>• Authorities are unable to cope adequately with the situation due to insufficient technical or professional, organizational experiences, and necessary supplies or equipment (eg. Drugs, vaccines, laboratory diagnostic materials, vector control materials, etc.); </p><p>• Risk of international transmission. </p><p><b>Public health intervention: </b></p><p>Successful intervention requires rapid assessment to determine whether the breakdown points of infrastructure have occurred. Disaster managers, public health specialists, and health care providers should pay specific attention to the degree to which infection control measures have been affected during the acute disaster phase and should repair those defects and treat the cases that have been known. </p><p><b>2.5. Pest Infestation </b></p><p>Pest infestation can cause tremendous damage to crop production and thus undermine the food security of a particular area. Locust </p><p>(desert and migratory) and grasshopper\'s infestations are the main threats in sub-Saharan Africa. Current pest monitoring and control programs together with the promotion of agricultural diversity have lessened, though by no means eradicated, the threats of food shortages due to infestation. </p><p>The spread of emergent diseases and invasive species has increased dramatically in recent years. At the same time, numerous developments - such as the rapidly increasing trans-boundary movements of goods and people, trade liberalization, increasing concerns about food safety and the environment - have heightened the need for international cooperation in controlling and managing trans-boundary pests and diseases. </p><p>Certain basic conditions affect the likelihood of trans-boundary pests and diseases establishing and spreading in regions or countries. These include: climate; geographical isolation; crops and livestock produced; production systems used; hosts and vectors widespread in or native to the country; and control methods used as part of routine agricultural management. </p><p>Recent food safety issues related to diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and avian flu have become a serious concern for consumers, farmers, food processors, food retailers and governments alike. Furthermore, food contamination with non-authorized food additives, chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and acryl amide, microbiological pathogens (<i>Salmonella, E. coli</i>,) and mycotoxins, among others, have created worldwide concern regarding the safety of food supplies. To better address the existing and emerging challenges, FAO is recommending, as well as applying, a comprehensive approach, food chain approach, to food safety and quality issues that shares the responsibility for providing safe food among all players in the food and agricultural sector, from food producers and processors to retailers and consumer households. </p><p><b>Management/ Public health intervention: </b></p><p>FAO recommends complementing regulation and control of end products, currently the main focus of many food safety programs, with preventive measures to control the introduction of hazards. This requires the adoption of good practices - in primary production, postharvest, processing and handling - that reduce the risk of microbiological and chemical contamination. In-plant controls of food processing operations should be based on: </p><p>• Good Hygienic Practices (GHP), </p><p>• Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and • The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which identifies and then monitors the most vulnerable points in a food production system. </p><p><b>2.6. Floods </b></p><p><b>Magnitude: </b>Global statistics show that floods are the most frequently recorded destructive events, accounting for about 30% of the world\'s disasters each year. The frequency of floods is increasing faster than any type of disaster. Much of this rise in incidence can be attributed to <b>uncontrolled urbanization</b>, <b>deforestation</b>, and more recently, <b>the effect of El Niño</b>. Floods may also accompany other natural disasters, such as sea surges during hurricanes and tsunamis following earthquake. </p><p><b>Impact </b></p><p>Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple communities. Except for flash floods, flooding causes few deaths. Widespread and long-lasting detrimental effects include mass homelessness, disruption of communications and health care systems, and heavy loss of business, livestock, crops, and grain, particularly in densely populated, low lying areas like that of the <b>Awash Valley</b>. The frequent repetition of flooding means a constant or even increasing drain on the economy for rural as well as urban populations. </p><p><b>Acute effect: </b>The early health effects of floods include death through drowning and accidents such as falls, electrocution and the effect of landslides. People lose their homes and often also lose their source of food and water. If the drinking water supply and sanitation system is already inadequate, flooding poses a further major health threat. Sanitation is a major problem in all flooded areas, as demonstrated by recent floods in Mexico, Ghana Mozambique and in Ethiopia. Industrial waste, such as engine oil and refuse dumps, adds to the health risks of floods. </p><p>The severe flooding in China in 1998 killed more than 5,500 people and left at least 21 million homeless (Kriner, 1999). </p><p><b>Long term effect: </b>In addition to the acute effects, the floodwaters provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and an increased risk of diseases such as dengue, malaria and Rift Valley Fever. They also displace rodent populations, which may cause human outbreaks of leptospirosis and Hantavirus infection. The combined effects of open sewage and reduced opportunities for good personal hygiene also favor the spread of infections causing diarrhea, such as cholera and gastrointestinal viruses. Flooding in the horn of Africa in 1997, associated with ENSO, and caused an upsurge in cholera deaths due to the lethal combination of damage to sanitation and contamination of water supplies (WHO, 1998). During flooding in Bolivia and Peru in the mid 1980s, increases in diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory diseases were recorded (WHO, 1999). Prolonged heavy rainfall causes fewer deaths than floods, but the infection risk is just as high in areas of poor sanitation. </p><p>Flooding affects health indirectly through the <b>widespread damage to the infrastructure </b>of a community: its roads, buildings, equipment, drainage, sewerage and water supply systems. For example, during flooding in Peru in 1997/98, nearly a tenth of the health facilities were damaged: in Ecuador during the same period 2% of the hospitals were put out of action by a combination of flooding, mud, damage to sewerage systems and contamination of the drinking water supply. The mental distress of flooding may persist long after the floods have receded, since people have lost their homes, their livelihood and their confidence.<b> </b></p><p><b>Risk of morbidity and mortality </b></p><p>Flood related mortality varies from country to country. Flash flooding such as from excessive rainfall or sudden release of water from a dam, is the cause of most flood-related deaths. Most flood-related death victims become trapped in their car and drown when attempting to drive through (or attempting to cross in the case of rural settings) rising of swiftly moving water. Other deaths have been caused by wading, bicycling, or other recreational activities in flooded areas. </p><p><b>Life-threatening characteristics of floods: </b></p><p>• Absence of warning of a flood (either \'official\' warning or warning derived from cues e.g. heavy rain). </p><p>• High floodwater velocities (like in hilly or mountainous terrain or where stream disgorge on to plains from upland areas; in river valleys with steep gradients; in areas behind floods embankments or natural barriers which may breach or overtop, below dams which may break). </p><p>• Rapid speed of flood onset (like in areas when streams are \'flashy\' i.e. rise and fall rapidly; these are usually urban areas or arid rural areas where soil surface becomes compacted and hard; or in areas where high floodwater velocities are expected). </p><p>• Deep floodwater: where floodwater is in excess of one meter depth (occurs in or close to river channels; in depression which may not be easy to identify by eye; behind overtopped flood embankments and in basements of buildings). </p><p>• Long duration floods (like where land is flat, flooding is extensive; river gradients are very low, channels are obstructed, and flood water become trapped behind natural or artificial barriers). </p><p>• Flood has more than one peak (not atypical on complex river systems where tributaries contribute to river flows, or where flooding is tidal). </p><p>• Debris load of floodwaters (usually greatest in high velocity floods; floodwater may contain trees, building debris etc which may either provide floating refuge, or threaten life). </p><p>• Characteristics of accompanying weather (especially windy, unusually cold or hot weather). </p><p>• Flood may display combinations of characteristics! </p><p><b>Management/ Protective Measures </b></p><p><b>Before a Flood</b>, you should: </p><p>• Avoid building in a floodplain unless you elevate and reinforce your home. </p><p>• Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel if susceptible to flooding. </p><p>• Install "check valves" in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home. </p><p>• Construct barriers (levees, beams, floodwalls) to stop floodwater from entering the building. </p><p>• Seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds to avoid seepage. </p><p>• Learning swimming skill is helpful. </p><p><b>During a Flood</b> </p><p>If a flood is likely in your area, you should: </p><p>• Listen to the radio or television for information. </p><p>• Be aware that flash flooding can occur. If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move immediately to higher ground. Do not wait for instructions to move. </p><p>• Be aware of streams, drainage channels, canyons, and other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without such typical warnings as rain clouds or heavy rain. </p><p>If you must prepare to evacuate, you should do the following: </p><p>• Secure your home. If you have time, bring in outdoor furniture. Move essential items to an upper floor. </p><p>• Turn off utilities at the main switches or valves if instructed to do so. Disconnect electrical appliances. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water. </p><p>If you have to leave your home, remember these evacuation tips: </p><p>• Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you. </p><p>• Do not drive into flooded areas. If flood-waters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely. </p><p><b>After a Flood: </b> </p><p>The following are guidelines for the period following a flood: </p><p>• Listen for news reports to learn whether the community\'s water supply is safe to drink. </p><p>• Avoid floodwaters; water may be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. Water may also be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines. </p><p>• Avoid moving water. </p><p>• Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded. Roads may have weakened and could collapse under the weight of a car. </p><p>• Stay away from downed power lines, and report them to the power authorities. </p><p>• Return home only when authorities indicate it is safe. </p><p>• Stay out of any building if it is surrounded by floodwaters. </p><p>• Use extreme caution when entering buildings; there may be hidden damage, particularly in foundations. </p><p>• Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pits, and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged sewage systems are serious health hazards. </p><p>• Clean and disinfect everything that got wet. Mud left from floodwater can contain sewage and chemicals. </p><p><b>Public Health Interventions</b> </p><p>• Conduct needs assessment to determine the status of public health infrastructure, utilities (e.g. water, sewage, electricity), and health, medical, and pharmaceutical needs. </p><p>• Conduct surveillance of drinking water sources, injuries, increases in vector populations, and endemic, water-borne and vector-borne diseases. </p><p>• Organize delivery of health care services and supplies, and continuity of care. </p><p>• Educate public regarding proper sanitation and hygiene. </p><p>• Educate public regarding proper clean up. </p><p><b>2.7. Tsunamis </b></p><p><b>Definition</b>: A tsunami is a series of waves generated by an under sea disturbance such as an earthquake. From the area of the disturbance, the waves will travel outward in all directions, much like the ripples caused by throwing a rock into a pond. As the waves approach the shallow coastal waters, they appear normal and speed decreases. Then as the tsunami nears coastline, it may grow to a great height and smash into the shore, causing such destruction. </p><p>Tsunamis (pronounced soo-ná-mees), also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called "tidal waves"), are a <b>series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance</b> such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more. </p><p><b>Protective Measures </b></p><p>Guidelines for what you should do if a tsunami is likely in your area: </p><p>• Turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning </p><p>• Move inland to higher ground immediately and stay there. </p><p>• If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature\'s tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately </p><p>Guidelines for the period following a tsunami: </p><p>• Stay away from flooded and damaged areas until officials say it is safe to return. </p><p>• Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to boats and people. </p><p><b>2.8. Earthquakes </b></p><p><b>Definition</b>: Earthquakes are sudden slippages or movements in a portion of the earth\'s crust accompanied by a series of vibrations. Aftershocks of similar or lesser intensity can follow the main quake. </p><p>Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year. An earthquake is generally considered to be the most destructive and frightening of all forces of nature. </p><p><b>Magnitude</b>: </p><p>The Richter scale, used as an indication of the force of an earthquake, measures the magnitude and intensity or energy released by the quake. This value is calculated based on data recordings from a single observation point for events anywhere on earth, but it does not address the possible damaging effects of the earthquake. According to global observations, an average of two earthquakes of a Richter magnitude 8 or slightly more occur every year. A one digit drop in magnitude equates with a tenfold increase in frequency. Therefore, earthquakes of magnitude 7 or more generally occur 20 times in a year, while those with a magnitude 6 or more occur approximately 200 times. </p><p>Specific active seismic zones have been identified around the globe. Millions of people live in these seismic zones and are exposed to threat of an earthquake daily. The damage caused by an earthquake can be extensive especially to incompatible building types and construction techniques. Also, an earthquake usually ignite fires, which can spread rapidly among damaged buildings if the water system has been disabled and fire services cannot access the site of the fire. </p><p><b>Impact </b></p><p>Earthquake losses, like those of other disasters, tend to cause <b>more financial losses in industrialized countries</b> and, as the developed countries have better early warning systems and life saving means,<b> more injuries and deaths occur in undeveloped countries</b>. Deaths and injuries from earthquakes vary according to the type of housing available, time of day of occurrence, and population density. Common injuries include cuts, broken bones, crush injuries, and dehydration from being trapped in rubble. Stress reactions are also common. Morbidity and mortality can occur during the actual quake, the delayed collapse of unsound structures, or clean-up activity. </p><p><b>Public health intervention </b></p><p>Public health officials can intervene both in advance of and after earthquakes to prevent post-earthquake injuries. The safety of homes and the work environment can be improved by building standards that require stricter codes and use of safer materials. Measures to prevent injuries include securing appliances, securing hanging items on walls or overhead, turning off utilities, storing hazardous materials in safe, well-ventilated areas, and checking homes for hazards such as windows and glass that might shatter. </p><p><b>Protective Measures</b> </p><p><b>Before an Earthquake</b>: </p><p>• Repair defective electrical wiring, leaky gas cylinders, and inflexible utility connections. </p><p>• Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves. Fasten shelves, mirrors, and large picture frames to walls. </p><p>• Store bottled foods, glass, china clay, and other breakables on low shelves or in cabinets that fasten shut. </p><p>• Anchor overhead lighting fixtures. </p><p>• Be sure the residence is firmly anchored to its foundation. </p><p>Install flexible pipe fittings to avoid gas or water leaks. Flexible fittings are more<b> </b></p><p>• Resistant to breakage. </p><p>• Locate safe spots in each room under a sturdy table or against an inside wall. </p><p>• Hold earthquake drills with your family members: Drop, cover, and hold on! </p><p><b>During an Earthquake</b>: minimize your movements during an earthquake to a few steps to a nearby safe place. Stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe. </p><p>I. If you are indoor: </p><p>• Take cover under a sturdy desk, table, or bench or against an inside wall, and hold on. If there isn\'t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building. </p><p>• Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture. </p><p>• Stay in bed - if you are there when the earthquake strikes-hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place. </p><p>• Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load bearing doorway. </p><p>• Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Most injuries during earthquakes occur when people are hit by falling objects when entering into or exiting from buildings. </p><p>• Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on. </p><p>• DO NOT use elevators. </p><p>II. If you are Outdoors: </p><p>• Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires. </p><p>III. If you are In a moving vehicle: </p><p>• Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. </p><p>• Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped, watching for road and bridge damage. </p><p>IV. If you are trapped under debris: </p><p>• Do not light a match. Do not move about or kick up dust. </p><p>• Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. </p><p>• Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort-shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust. </p><p><b>After an Earthquake</b>: be prepared for aftershocks. These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake, but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures. </p><p>• Open cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves. </p><p>• Stay away from damaged areas unless your assistance has been specifically requested by police, fire, or relief organizations. </p><p>• Be aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas. </p><p><b>Public health interventions</b>: </p><p>• Encourage earthquake drills to practice emergency procedures; </p><p>• Recommend items for inclusion in an extensive first aid kit and survival kit for home and automobile, and encourage maintenance of those kits; </p><p>• Teach basic precautions regarding safe water and safe food; </p><p>• Ensure the provision of emergency medical care to those who seek immediate care in the first three to five days after an earthquake; </p><p>• Ensure continuity of care for those who have lost access to prescriptions, home care, and other medical necessities; </p><p>• Conduct surveillance for communicable disease and injuries, including location and severity of injury, disposition of patients, and follow up contact information; </p><p>• Prepare media advisories with appropriate warning and advice for injury prevention; </p><p>• Establish environmental control; </p><p>• Facilitate use of surveillance forms by search and rescue teams to record types of buildings, addresses of site, type of collapse, amount of dust, fire or toxic hazards, location of victims, and nature and severity of injuries. </p><p><b>2.9. Pollutions and health consequences of pollutions: </b></p><p><b>Definition: </b></p><p><b>Pollution:</b> is undesirable state of the natural environment being contaminated with harmful substances as a consequence of human activities. Pollution is the contamination of the air, water, or earth by harmful or potentially harmful substances. </p><p>Over the past 100 years, the state of the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments has declined in virtually all respects. Environmental degradation and resource depletion have escalated particularly over the past three decades due to the cumulative impacts of <b>rapid growth in population</b>, <b>intensive agriculture</b>, <b>urbanization</b> and <b>industrialization</b>. The priority list of environmental challenges includes land degradation, deforestation, declining biodiversity and marine resources, water scarcity, and deteriorating water and air quality. </p><p>A major reason for these adverse environmental trends in Africa is that most people and countries are poor. Their <b>poverty</b> is both a <b>cause and a consequence of environmental degradation</b>. However, the main cause of many environmental problems is the persistence of economic, agricultural, energy, industrial and other sectoral policies which largely neglect - and fail to avoid - harmful impacts on the environment and natural resource base. </p><p><b>2.9.1. Air pollution: </b></p><p><b>Air pollution </b>is the presence in the air of substances put there by the acts of man in concentrations sufficient to interfere with health, comfort, or safety, or with full use and enjoyment of property.<b> </b></p><p>The term is often used to identify undesirable substances produced by human activity. Air pollution usually designates the collection of substances that adversely affect human health, animals, and plants; deteriorates structures; interferes with commerce; or interferes with the enjoyment of life.<b> </b></p><p><b>Primary Pollutants &amp; their Health Effects: </b></p><p><b>Particulate Matter (PM): </b></p><p>Particulate matter consists of soot and dust particles that are smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Particulate matter is all particles smaller than 10 microns in diameter are classified as PM10 or coarse size particles. Fine size particles, or PM2.5, are those particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter. Sources of PM include diesel exhaust, soil dust, tire wear, and soot. These particles penetrate deeply into the lungs and are captured by lung tissue. A major contributor to the PM pollution problem is exhaust from diesel vehicles, which produce 79% of the particulate emissions from mobile sources. Exposure to PM pollution has been associated with<b> respiratory and cardiac problems</b>, <b>infections</b>, <b>asthma attacks,</b> <b>lung cancer</b> and <b>decreased life expectancy</b>. The World Health Organization has estimated that <b>500,000 premature </b><b>deaths each year</b> may be associated with PM pollution. The American Lung Association believes that PM2.5 represents the most serious threat to our health. Segments of the population that are more susceptible to PM pollution include children, athletes, senior citizens, and people with pre-existing respiratory problems. </p><p><b>Ozone (O3) </b></p><p>Ozone forms when <b>hydrocarbons </b>combine with <b>nitrogen oxides</b> and chemically react in <b>sunlight</b>. Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are primarily produced by motor vehicles and various industrial practices. <b>Ozone is a highly reactive oxidizing agent</b> that breaks-down organic materials. Ozone is the primary component of smog. A natural phenomenon called an "inversion layer" traps these gases and prevents them from dissipating into the atmosphere. <b>Symptoms of ozone exposure</b> are <b>coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue, throat dryness, chest pain, headache</b> and <b>nausea</b>. Ozone has been shown to cause inflammation of lung tissue and reduced lung capacity. Development of asthma, increased lung cancer mortality rates, and accelerated lung aging has all been linked to ozone exposure. Lung damage from long-term exposure to ozone can be permanent, while short-term exposure appears to be reversible. Ozone reduces the respiratory system\'s ability to fight infection and remove foreign particles such as particulate matter. Segments of the population that are more susceptible to ozone pollution include children, athletes, senior citizens, and people with pre-existing respiratory problems. </p><p><b>Hydrocarbons </b></p><p>Hydrocarbons are a class of reactive organic gases (ROG), which are formed solely of hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of ozone and the resulting smog problem. Carcinogenic forms of hydrocarbons are considered hazardous air pollutants, or air toxics. <b>The incomplete burning of any organic matter such as oil, wood, or rubber produces hydrocarbons</b>. Combustion engine exhaust, oil refineries, and oil-fueled power plants are the primary sources of hydrocarbons. Another source of hydrocarbons is evaporation from petroleum fuels, solvents, dry cleaning solutions, and paint. The primary health effect of hydrocarbons results from the formation of ozone and its related health effects. High levels of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere can interfere with oxygen intake by reducing the amount of available oxygen through displacement. </p><p><b>Nitrogen Oxides (NOx</b><b><i>): </i></b><b>Nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)</b><b> </b></p><p>• The two forms of nitrogen oxide found in the atmosphere. </p><p>• Contribute to the formation of ozone, production of particulate matter pollution, and acid deposition. </p><p>• Produced by factories, motor vehicles and power plants that burn fossil fuels </p><p>• NO2 irritates lung tissue, causes bronchitis and pneumonia, and reduces resistance to respiratory infections </p><p>• Frequent or long-term exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides can increase the incidence of acute respiratory illness in children. </p><p><b> Carbon Monoxide (CO) </b></p><p>• CO is colorless, odorless gas produced by burning organic matter such as oil, natural gas, fuel, wood, and charcoal. </p><p>• Displaces oxygen in red blood cells, which reduces the amount of oxygen that human cells need for respiration. </p><p>• Exposure to CO can result in fatigue, angina, reduced visual perception, reduced dexterity, and death. </p><p>• The elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions are particularly sensitive </p><p>• Extremely deadly in an enclosed space, such as a garage or bedroom. </p><p><b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) </b></p><p>• A colorless gas produced by motor vehicles, refineries, and power plants that burn fossil fuels. </p><p>• Reduces respiratory volume, and increases breathing resistance in those exposed, especially asthmatics. </p><p>• Increases nasal airway resistance. </p><p><b>2.9.2. Water pollution and contamination </b></p><p>Water is necessary for industries which are therefore often located near a river. Thus, natural disasters may not only affect the water resources and their management directly but floods and earthquakes may also destroy industries producing or using toxic materials or dangerous chemicals which might be released into floodwaters. </p><p>These harmful materials include organic wastes, sediments, minerals, nutrients, thermal pollutants, toxic chemicals, and other hazardous substances. Organic wastes are produced by animals and humans, and include such things as fecal matter, crop debris, yard clippings, food wastes, and rubber, plastic, wood, and disposable diapers. </p><p>Their origin is human industrial activity and they can be avoided through <b>properly applied policies </b>and<b> good decision making</b>. With increased urbanization, increase in population density and industrialization, the problem of pollution might also become more important. The polluted water may cause death or diseases by poisoning. </p><p>Worldwide, a considerable number of diseases are linked to the interrelated problems of water quality, water availability, sanitation and hygiene. </p><p>Natural networks of rivers, lakes and marshes, also play a role in the transmission of water-related and vector-borne diseases. If these undergo increased flooding, community water supplies could become contaminated, leading to greater incidence of faecal-oral diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and diarrhea. </p><p>Developing countries are at most risk with respect to waterborne and Water-washed diseases and urban communities are at greater risk than rural communities. </p><p>Any increase in heavy precipitation and consequently in runoff from agricultural lands, would also be likely to increase contamination of water with chemicals such as pesticides. </p><p><b>2.10. Global warming</b> </p><p><b>How might the climate change?</b> </p><p>The earth\'s climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of <b>greenhouse gases</b> primarily <b>carbon dioxide, methane</b>, and <b>nitrous oxide.</b> The heat-trapping property of these gases is undisputed. Although uncertainty exists about exactly how earth\'s climate responds to these gases, global temperatures are rising. </p><p>Scientists use computer-based models to predict the effects on global climate of different levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. According to the most recent projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global mean temperature could increase by 1.4°C to 5.8°C between 1990 and 2100. </p><p>The climatic effects of such a temperature increase might include: </p><p>• More frequent extreme high maximum temperatures and less frequent extreme low minimum temperatures; </p><p>• An increase in the variability of climate, with changes to both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events; </p><p>• Alterations to the natural biological range of certain infectious diseases; </p><p>• Rising sea levels. </p><p><b>Effects of global warming </b></p><p>Global warming can be expected to produce changes in the frequency of intense rainfall. Higher sea-surface temperatures can be expected to increase the intensity of tropical cyclones and to expand the area over which they may develop. Rainfall intensity is likely to increase with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and there may be an increasing concentration of rainfall on fewer rain days. </p><p>As climatic warming occurs, there will be notable changes in the hydrology of Arctic areas. River-ice regime might be altered and substantial effects on the hydrology can be expected that will affect flow, water levels, and storage. It is reasonable to think that an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods may be associated with an increase in the occurrence and severity of droughts in order to compensate the first extreme and to reestablish the natural energy and water balance. </p><p><b>Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the result of global warming </b></p><p>Overexposure to UV radiation in sunlight can result in painful sunburn. It can also lead to more serious health effects, including skin cancer, premature aging of the skin, and other skin disorders; cataracts and other eye damage; and <b>immune </b>system suppression. </p><p>Perhaps the most obvious impact of global warming will be the direct effects: a warmer planet will experience more extreme heat waves. As seen in Europe, the scorching weather may have claimed as many as 35,000 lives in 2003; heat waves often lead to an increase in the number of human deaths. </p><p>Technological adaptations such as the installation of effective air-conditioners and the construction of heat-minimizing houses will happen more quickly among the rich, so heat waves are likely to have a disproportionate effect in less-developed countries and in the poorer segments of rich societies. </p><p><b>Rising sea levels</b> <b>as the result of global warming</b> </p><p><b>Global warming </b>is predicted to <b>lead to thermal expansion of sea water.</b> Scientists predict that sea levels will rise as the global temperature rises, due to the <b>melting of land-based ice</b> in the Polar Regions and <b>glaciers</b>, and the thermal expansion of the oceans. According to the most recent projections, sea levels could rise between 9 and 88 centimeters by the year 2100. A rise of this magnitude would have disastrous consequences for people living on low-lying islands, such as the Maldives group in the Indian Ocean and many South Pacific islands. In parts of Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, China, the Netherlands, Florida, and other low-lying coastal areas already suffering from poor drainage, agriculture is likely to become increasingly difficult to sustain. </p><p>Higher sea levels lead to coastal flooding and an increase in the frequency of extreme high water levels from storm surges. Related problems are the contamination of coastal freshwater supplies with encroaching sea water, and the degradation of fishing and agricultural areas. </p><p><b>Infectious diseases</b> <b>as the result of global warming: </b></p><p>Many infectious diseases are dependent on vector organisms, which are sensitive to environmental factors and therefore will be affected by global warming. Biological modeling under various climate scenarios suggests a widening of the potential transmission zone of some disease-causing pathogens and their vectors, such as mosquitoes. </p><p>Scientists speculate that if temperatures rise under global warming, the incidence of diseases caused by food-poisoning and by the contamination of drinking (and swimming) water could increase dramatically. </p><p><b>Extreme events and disasters</b> <b>as the result of global warming</b>: </p><p>Most computer models generated by scientists indicate that the future climate will be more variable than the past and those droughts and floods will be more severe. Some of the health effects of weather-related disasters, in addition to the immediate death and injury to people and damage to property, include: </p><p>• Increases in psychological stress, depression, and feelings of isolation amongst people affected by natural disasters; </p><p>• Decreases in nutrition due to poorer agricultural yields caused, for example, by prolonged drought and problems of food distribution; </p><p>• Increases in disease transmission due to a breakdown in sewerage and garbage services. </p><p><b>Effects of Climate Variations and Climate Change </b></p><p>Climate variations is a term referring to year to year or inter-annual fluctuations in the annual cycle, including also anomalous cycles ranging from two to ten years in duration. </p><p>Climate variability persistent over a ten years period is referred to as climate change. Scientists are now increasingly able to link extreme weather events such as droughts and storms with climate variations and climate change. The Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1995) concluded that: there is evidence, from climate models and hydrological impact studies, which flood frequencies, are likely to increase with global warming. </p><p>Climate change may increase the risk of death, according to World Health Organization report of 2006. Many important diseases that affect developing countries are sensitive to climate variations, according to the report, and even a proportionally small change in the global incidence of some diseases could result in significant public health impacts far into the future. The authors of <i>Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses</i> quantified the relative risk of death in 2030 from diarrhea, malaria, and cardiovascular disease related to heat and cold, malnutrition, and flooding in several developed and developing regions (22). </p><p>"Provision of clean water and sanitation not only cuts overall diarrhea rates, but also decreases the importance of the bacterial pathogens that respond positively to temperature, and decreases risks of diarrhea outbreaks following floods." </p><p><b>El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</b> </p><p>One of the most spectacular climate variation consequences is El-Niño. </p><p>The El Niño event, <b>a warm water current along the coast of Peru and Chile</b>, is part of a climatic phenomenon known as the El-Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which strongly affects tropical and midlatitude countries. Impacts of ENSO are droughts over Southeast Asia, northeastern Brazil and southern Africa, heavy rains in the tropical Pacific and the west coast of the Americas at tropical and mid-latitudes. The generation of ENSO is not yet fully understood. Its recurrence interval varies from two to seven years, with an average of four years. </p><p>Source: http://www.who.int/globalchange/en/ (date of access Aug 10, 2006) </p><p>Figure 6: Effects of climate change on the ecosystem </p><p><b>2.11</b>. <b>Ozone depletion</b>: </p><p><b>The Connection between Ozone Depletion and UVB Radiation</b>: Reductions in ozone levels will not result in the sun\'s output of UVB change; rather, less ozone means less protection, and will lead to higher levels of UVB reaching the Earth\'s surface hence more UVB reaches the Earth. Studies have shown that in the Antarctic, the amount of UVB measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone hole. Another study confirmed the relationship between reduced ozone and increased UVB levels in Canada during the past several years. </p><p>UVB is a kind of ultraviolet light from the sun (and sun lamps) that has adverse effects on lives. Particularly it is effective at damaging DNA. It is a cause of melanoma and other types of skin cancer. It has also been linked to damage to some materials, crops, and marine organisms. The ozone layer protects the Earth against most UVB coming from the sun. It is always important to protect oneself against UVB, even in the absence of ozone depletion, by wearing hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen. </p><p><b>Causes of Ozone Depletion </b></p><p>Ozone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the production and destruction of stratospheric ozone is tipped in favour of destruction. Although natural phenomena can cause temporary ozone loss, chlorine and bromine released from man-made compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are now accepted as the main cause of this depletion. </p><p>It was first suggested by Drs. M. Molina and S. Rowland in 1974 that a man-made group of compounds known as the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were likely to be the main source of ozone depletion. However, this idea was not seriously taken until the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985 by the British Antarctic Survey. </p><p>Chlorofluorocarbons are not "washed" back to Earth by rain or destroyed in reactions with other chemicals. They simply do not break down in the lower atmosphere and they can remain in the atmosphere from 20 to 120 years or more. As a consequence of their relative stability, CFCs are instead transported into the stratosphere where they are eventually broken down by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun, releasing free chlorine. The chlorine becomes actively involved in the process of destruction of ozone. The net result is that two molecules of ozone are replaced by three of molecular oxygen, leaving the chlorine free to repeat the process: </p><p>Cl + O3   ClO + O2 </p><p>ClO + O   Cl + O2 </p><p>Ozone is converted to oxygen, leaving the chlorine atom free to repeat the process up to 100,000 times, resulting in a reduced level of ozone. Bromine compounds, or halons, can also destroy stratospheric ozone. Compounds containing chlorine and bromine from man-made compounds are known as industrial halocarbons. Emissions of CFCs have accounted for roughly 80% of total stratospheric ozone depletion. </p><p>The problem of ozone depletion is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere. The origins of these compounds are chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), used as cooling substances in air-conditioners and refrigerators, or as aerosol propellants, and bromofluorocarbons (halons), used in fire extinguishers. As a result of depletion of the ozone layer more UV radiation comes to Earth and causes damage to living organisms. UV radiation seems responsible for skin cancer in humans; it lowers production of phytoplankton, and thus affects other aquatic organisms. It can also influence the growth of terrestrial plants. </p><p><b>The Effects of Ozone Depletion </b></p><p><b>On Human Health </b></p><p>Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes nonmelanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked to cataracts. All sunlight contains some UVB, even with normal ozone levels. It is always important to limit exposure to the sun. However, ozone depletion will increase the amount of UVB and the risk of health effects. </p><p><b>On Plants </b></p><p>Physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by UVB radiation, even by the amount of UVB in present-day sunlight. Despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effects and a limited ability to adapt to increased levels of UVB, plant growth can be directly affected by UVB radiation. </p><p>Indirect changes caused by UVB (such as changes in plant form, how nutrients are distributed within the plant, timing of developmental phases and secondary metabolism) may be equally, or sometimes more, important than damaging effects of UVB. These changes can have important implications for plant competitive balance, herbivory, plant diseases, and biogeochemical cycles. </p><p><b>On Marine Ecosystems </b></p><p>Phytoplankton forms the foundation of aquatic food webs. Phytoplankton productivity is limited to the euphotic zone, the upper layer of the water column in which there is sufficient sunlight to support net productivity. The position of the organisms in the euphotic zone is influenced by the action of wind and waves. In addition, many phytoplanktons are capable of active movements that enhance their productivity and, therefore, their survival. Exposure to solar UVB radiation has been shown to affect both orientation mechanisms and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms. Scientists have demonstrated a direct reduction in phytoplankton production due to ozone depletion-related increases in UVB. One study has indicated a 6-12% reduction in the marginal ice zone (43). </p><p>Solar UVB radiation has been found to cause damage to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other animals. The most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval development. Even at current levels, solar UVB radiation is a limiting factor, and small increases in UVB exposure could result in significant reduction in the size of the population of animals that eat these smaller creatures. </p><p><b>On Biogeochemical Cycles </b></p><p>Increases in solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles, thus altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse and chemically-important trace gases e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS) and possibly other gases, including ozone. These potential changes would contribute to biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks that attenuate or reinforce the atmospheric buildup of these gases. </p><p>UVB: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280-320 nanometers produced by the Sun </p><p>UVC: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths shorter than 280 nanometers </p><p><b>2.12. Tornado </b></p><p>Tornados are rapidly whirling, funnel-shaped air spirals that emerge from a violent thunderstorm and reach the ground. Tornados can have a wind velocity of up to 200 miles per hour and generate sufficient force to destroy even massive buildings. The extent of damage depends on updrafts within the tornado funnel, the tornado\'s atmospheric pressure (which is often lower than the surrounding barometric pressure), and the effects of flying debris. </p><p><b>Risk of Morbidity and Mortality </b></p><p>Injuries from tornados occur due to flying debris or people being thrown by the high winds (i.e., head injuries, soft tissue injury, and secondary wound infection). Stress-related disorders are more common, as is disease related to loss of utilities, potable water, or shelter. </p><p><b>Injury Prevention </b></p><p>In the event of a tornado, the residents should take shelter in a basement if possible, away from windows, while protecting their heads. People with special needs should have a "buddy" who has a copy of the list and who knows of the emergency box. </p><p><b>Public Health Interventions </b></p><p>• Work with emergency management on tornado shelter drills for vulnerable communities. </p><p>• Conduct needs assessment using maps that detail preexisting neighborhoods, including landmarks, and aerial reconnaissance. </p><p>• Ensure the provision of medical care, shelter, food, and water. </p><p>• Establish environmental controls. </p><p>• Establish a surveillance system based at both clinical sites and shelters. </p><p><b>2.13. Fires </b></p><p>There are two types of fire disasters. They are domestic and wild fires. Fires can be triggered or exacerbated by lightning, high winds, earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and deliberate setting of fire by human beings. Lightning is the most significant natural contributor to fires affecting the building environment. Buildings with rooftop storage tanks for flammable liquids are particularly susceptible. </p><p>To protect yourself, it is important to understand the basic characteristics of fire. Fire spreads quickly; there is no time to gather valuables or make a phone call. In just two minutes, a fire can become life-threatening. In five minutes, a residence can be engulfed in flames. Heat and smoke from fire can be more dangerous than the flames. Inhaling the super-hot air can sear your lungs. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you disoriented and drowsy. Instead of being awakened by a fire, you may fall into a deeper sleep. <b>Asphyxiation</b> is the leading cause of fire deaths, exceeding burns by a three-to-one ratio. </p><p><b>Management </b></p><p><b>Before a Fire (mostly for developed countries)</b> </p><p>Smoke Alarms </p><p>• Install smoke alarms. Properly working smoke alarms decrease your chances of dying in a fire by half. </p><p>• Place smoke alarms on every level of your residence. Place them outside bedrooms on the ceiling or high on the wall (4 to 12 inches from ceiling), at the top of open stairways, or at the bottom of enclosed stairs and near (but not in) the kitchen. </p><p>• Test and clean smoke alarms once a month and replace batteries at least once a year. Replace smoke alarms once every 10 years. </p><p>• Have record of fire brigades telephone in safe and accessible to member of the family. </p><p>• Making aware the people about care (prevention), escape mechanisms. </p><p><b>Escaping the Fire</b> </p><p>• Review escape routes with your family. Practice escaping from each room. </p><p>• Make sure windows are not nailed or painted shut. Make sure security gratings on windows have a fire safety opening feature so they can be easily opened from the inside. </p><p>• Consider escape ladders if your residence has more than one level, and ensure that burglar bars and other antitheft mechanisms that block outside window entry are easily opened from the inside. </p><p>• Teach family members to stay low to the floor (where the air is safer in a fire) when escaping from a fire. </p><p>• Clean out storage areas. Do not let trash, such as old newspapers, magazines, other materials and equipments accumulation. </p><p>With regards to Flammable Items </p><p>• Never use gasoline, benzene, naphtha, or similar flammable liquids indoors. </p><p>• Store flammable liquids in approved containers in well-ventilated storage areas. </p><p>• Never smoke near flammable liquids. </p><p>• Discard all rags or materials that have been soaked in flammable liquids after you have used them. Safely discard them outdoors in a metal container. </p><p>• Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top. The chimney should be at least three feet higher than the roof. Remove branches hanging above and around the chimney. </p><p>With regards to Heating Sources </p><p>• Be careful when using alternative heating sources. </p><p>• Place heaters at least three feet away from flammable materials. Make sure the floor and nearby walls are properly insulated. </p><p>• Use only the type of fuel designated for your unit and follow manufacturer\'s instructions. </p><p>• Store ashes in a metal container outside and away from your residence. </p><p>• Keep open flames away from walls, furniture, drapery, and flammable items. </p><p>• Keep a screen in front of the fireplace. </p><p>• Have heating units inspected and cleaned annually by a certified specialist. </p><p>With regards to Matches and Smoking </p><p>• Keep matches and lighters up high, away from children, and, if possible, in a locked cabinet. </p><p>• Never smoke in bed or when drowsy or medicated. Provide smokers with deep, sturdy ashtrays. Douse cigarette and cigar butts with water before disposal. </p><p>With regards to Electrical Wiring </p><p>• Have the electrical wiring in your residence checked by an electrician. </p><p>• Inspect extension cords for frayed or exposed wires or loose plugs. </p><p>• Make sure outlets have cover plates and no exposed wiring. </p><p>• Make sure wiring does not run under rugs, over nails, or across high-traffic areas. </p><p>• Do not overload extension cords or outlets. If you need to plug in two or three appliances, get a UL-approved unit with built-in circuit breakers to prevent sparks and short circuits. </p><p>• Make sure insulation does not touch bare electrical wiring. </p><p>Other Precautions </p><p>• Sleep with your door closed. </p><p>• Install fire extinguishers in your residence and teach family members how to use them. </p><p>• Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your residence. </p><p>• Ask your local fire department to inspect your residence for fire safety and prevention. </p><p>• Make buildings accessible to water source </p><p><b>During a Fire: </b></p><p>If your clothes catch on fire, you should: </p><p>• Stop, drop, and roll - until the fire is extinguished. Running only makes the fire burn faster. </p><p>To escape a fire, you should: </p><p>• Check closed doors for heat before you open them. If you are escaping through a closed door, use the back of your hand to feel the top of the door, the doorknob, and the crack between the door and door frame before you open it. <b>Never use the palm of your hand or fingers to test for heat</b> - burning those areas could impair your ability to escape a fire (i.e., ladders and crawling). </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Hot Door </p></td><td><p>Cool Door </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Do not open. Escape through a window. If you cannot escape, hang a white or light-colored sheet outside the window, alerting fire fighters to your presence. </p></td><td><p>Open slowly and ensure fire and/or smoke is not blocking your escape route. If your escape route is blocked, shut the door immediately and use an alternate escape route, such as a window. If clear, leave immediately through the door and close it behind you. <b>Be prepared to crawl</b>. Smoke and heat rise. The air is clearer and cooler near the floor. </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>• Crawl low under any smoke to your exit - heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling. </p><p>• Close doors behind you as you escape to delay the spread of the fire. </p><p>• Stay out once you are safely out. Do not reenter. </p><p><b>After a Fire</b> </p><p>• If you are with burn victims, or are a burn victim yourself, cool and cover burns to reduce chance of further injury or infection. </p><p>• If you detect heat or smoke when entering a damaged building, evacuate immediately. </p><p>• If you are a tenant, contact the landlord. </p><p>• If you have a safe or strong box, do not try to open it. It can hold intense heat for several hours. If the door is opened before the box has cooled, the contents could burst into flames. </p><p>• If you must leave your home because a building inspector says the building is unsafe, ask someone you trust to watch the property during your absence. </p><p><b>Wildfires:</b> </p><p>Wild land fires are classified into three categories: </p><p>• A <i>surface fire</i>: is the common type and burns along the floor of a forest, moving slowly and killing or damaging the trees; </p><p>• A <i>ground fire</i>: is usually started by lightning and burns on or below the forest floor; </p><p>• A <i>crown fire</i>: spreads rapidly by winds and moves quickly by jumping along the top of trees. Wildland fires are usually signaled by dense smoke that fills the area for miles around. </p><p>If heavy rains follow a fire, other natural disasters can occur, including landslides, mudflows, and floods. Once ground cover has been burned away, little is left to hold soil in place on steep slopes and hillsides. If the wild land fire destroyed the ground cover, then erosion becomes one of several potential problems. </p><p><b>Protective Measures </b></p><p>Before a Wildfire to prepare for wildfires, you should: </p><p>• Mark the entrance to your property with address signs that are clearly visible from the road. </p><p>• Keep lawns trimmed, leaves raked, and the roof and rain gutters free from debris such as dead limbs and leaves. </p><p>• Stack firewood at least 30 feet away from your residence. </p><p>• Store flammable materials, liquids, and solvents in metal containers outside your residence at least 30 feet away from structures and wooden fences. </p><p>• Create defensible space by thinning trees and brush within 30 feet around your residence. Beyond 30 feet, remove dead wood, debris, and low tree branches. </p><p>• Landscape your property with fire resistant plants and vegetation to prevent fire from spreading quickly. For example, hardwood trees are more fire-resistant than pine, evergreen, eucalyptus, or fir trees. </p><p>• Make sure water sources, such as hydrants, ponds, swimming pools, and wells, are accessible to the fire department. </p><p>• Use fire resistant, protective roofing and materials like stone, brick, and metal to protect your residence. Avoid using wood materials. </p><p>• Cover all exterior vents, attics, and eaves with metal mesh screens to prevent debris from collecting and to help keep sparks out. </p><p>• Install multi-pane windows, tempered safety glass, or fireproof shutters to protect large windows from radiant heat. </p><p>• Use fire-resistant draperies for added window protection. </p><p>• Have chimneys, wood stoves, and all home heating systems inspected and cleaned annually by a certified specialist. </p><p>• Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top. The chimney should be at least 3 feet above the roof. </p><p>• Remove branches hanging above and around the chimney. </p><p><b>Follow Local Burning Laws </b></p><p>• Before burning debris in a wooded area, make sure you notify local authorities, obtain a burning permit, and follow these guidelines: </p><p>• Use an approved incinerator with a safety lid or covering with holes no larger than 3/4 inch. </p><p>• Create at least a 10-foot clearing around the incinerator before burning debris. </p><p>• Have a fire extinguisher or garden hose on hand when burning debris. </p><p><b>During a Wildfire: </b></p><p>If a wildfire threatens your home and time permits, take the following precautions:<b> </b></p><p>• Shut off gas at the meter. Only a qualified professional can safely turn the gas back on. </p><p>• Turn off propane tanks. </p><p>• Place combustible patio furniture inside. </p><p>• Connect garden hose to outside taps. Place lawn sprinklers on the roof and near above-ground fuel tanks. Wet the roof. </p><p>• Wet or remove shrubs within 15 feet of your residence. </p><p>• Gather fire tools such as a rake, axe, handsaw or chainsaw, bucket, and shovel. </p><p>• Back your car into the garage or park it in an open space facing the direction of escape. </p><p>• Shut doors and roll up windows. Leave the key in the ignition and the car doors unlocked. Close garage windows and doors, but leave them unlocked. Disconnect automatic garage door openers. </p><p>• Open fireplace damper. Close fireplace screens. </p><p>• Close windows, vents, doors, blinds or noncombustible window coverings, and heavy drapes. Remove flammable drapes and curtains. </p><p>• Move flammable furniture into the center of the residence away from windows and sliding-glass doors. </p><p>• Close all interior doors and windows to prevent drafts. </p><p>• Place valuables that will not be damaged by water in a pool or pond. </p><p>If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Choose a route away from the fire hazard. Watch for changes in the speed and direction of the fire and smoke. </p><p><b>Risk of Morbidity and Mortality </b></p><p>Morbidity and mortality associated with wildfires include <b>burns, inhalation injuries, respiratory complications</b>, and <b>stress-related cardiovascular events</b> (exhaustion and myocardial infarction from fighting or fleeing the fire). </p><p><b>Public Health Interventions </b></p><p>More than four out of every five wildfires are started by people. <b>Negligent human behavior</b>, such as <b>smoking in forested areas</b> or <b>improperly extinguishing campfires</b>, are the causes of many forest fires. Another cause of forest fires is <b>lightning</b>. Prevention efforts include working with the fire service to educate people to: </p><p>• Build fires away from nearby trees or bushes, </p><p>• Be prepared to extinguish fire quickly and completely. </p><p>• Never leave a fire-even a burning cigarette-unattended. </p><p>• Encourage the development of a family wildfire evacuation plan if the area in your community is at risk for wildfire.<b> </b></p><p><b>2.14. Explosions </b></p><p>Explosions can inflict multi-system life-threatening injuries to many persons simultaneously. Contributing factors include the composition and amount of the materials involved the environment in which the event occurs, the method of delivery, such as a bomb, the distance between the victim and the blast, and the absence/presence of protective barriers or environmental hazards in the area of the blast. </p><p>To predict subsequent demand for medical care and resources needed, it is useful to remember that post-blast, half of the initial casualties will seek medical care over the first one-hour period. Those with minor injuries often arrive before the most severely injured, because they go directly to the closest hospitals using whatever transportation is available. Further, where the explosion has resulted in a structural collapse, victims will be more severely injured and their rescue can occur over prolonged time periods. </p><p><b>Morbidity and Mortality </b></p><p>The most common injuries for survivors of explosions are <b>penetrating</b> and <b>blunt trauma</b>. <b>Blast lung </b>is the most common fatal injury among initial survivors. Explosions in confined spaces (mines, buildings, or large vehicles) and/or structural collapse are associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Blast injuries can occur to any body system: auditory, digestive, circulatory, central nervous system, extremities, renal, and respiratory. Up to <b>10 percent of all blast survivors have significant eye injuries</b>. These injuries can occur with minimal discomfort initially and patients can come for care days, weeks, or even months after the event. Symptoms include eye pain or irritation, foreign body sensation, altered vision, periorbital swelling, or contusions. Clinical findings in the gastrointestinal tract may be absent until the onset of complications. Victims can also experience tinnitus, and/or temporary or permanent deafness from blasts. </p><p><b>Public Health Interventions </b></p><p>o Identify the medical institutions and personnel who can provide emergency care </p><p>o Ensure that the community preparedness plan includes structure for surge capacity.

Global summaries for 2002 indicated the occurrence of over 500 disasters, with more than </p><p>10,000 people killed, 600 million people affected, US$ 55 billion in total damages and US$ 13 billion in insured losses. Developing countries are disproportionately affected, with their losses rising to about five times higher per unit of GDP than for rich countries, sometimes exceeding a year or more of hard-won and desperately needed economic development. </p><p>The underlying problems of growing vulnerability to natural and technological hazards are largely outcome of short-sighted development activities. Every day development decisions are being made at local, national and international levels. Despite their importance, these developmental activities are more often factors that increase the vulnerability to hazard than reducing the risk. In other words, the vulnerability of communities is growing due to human activities that lead to increased poverty, greater urban density, environmental degradation and climate change. In addition to the aforementioned, the prominent consequences of disasters are summarized under the following headings: </p><p><b>3.2. Social reactions </b></p><p>The nature of disasters may intensify reactions of persons impacted by the event. The scope of the event, personal loss or injuries, and traumatic stimuli, all serve to impact reactions. Though reactions to disasters may vary between individuals, there are common reactions that are normal reactions to the abnormal event. Sometimes these stress reactions appear immediately following the disaster; in some cases, they are delayed for a few hours, a few days, weeks, or even months. These stress reactions may be categorized as physiological, cognitive/intellectual, emotional, and behavioral symptoms and may include the following: </p><p><b>Physiological Symptoms </b></p><p>• Fatigue </p><p>• Shock symptoms </p><p>• Nausea </p><p>• Headaches </p><p>• Vomiting </p><p>• Profuse sweating </p><p>• Fine motor tremors </p><p>• Chills </p><p>• Teeth grinding </p><p>• Muscle aches </p><p>• Dizziness </p><p><b>Cognitive/Intellectual Symptoms </b></p><p>• Memory loss </p><p>• Concentration problems/distractibility </p><p>• Reduced attention span </p><p>• Decision making difficulties </p><p>• Calculation difficulties </p><p>• Confusing trivial with major issues </p><p><b>Emotional Symptoms </b></p><p>• Anxiety </p><p>• Feeling overwhelmed </p><p>• Grief </p><p>• Identification with victims </p><p>• Depression </p><p>• Anticipation of harm to self or others </p><p>• Irritability </p><p><b>Behavioral Symptoms </b></p><p>• Insomnia </p><p>• Crying easily </p><p>• Substance abuse </p><p>• Gallows humor </p><p>• Gait change </p><p>• Ritualistic behavior </p><p>• Hyper vigilance </p><p>• Unwillingness to leave scene </p><p>Although these may be normal reactions to the event, persons providing disaster mental health services should recognize when reactions are severe enough to refer an individual for services of a mental health professional. </p><p><b>3.3. Factors which may affect reactions </b></p><p>• Lack of warning </p><p>• Scope of the event </p><p>• Abrupt contrast of scene </p><p>• Personal loss or injury </p><p>• Type of disaster </p><p>• Traumatic stimuli </p><p>• Nature of the destructive agent </p><p>• Human error </p><p>• Time of occurrence </p><p>• Lack of opportunity for effective action </p><p>• Degree of uncertainty </p><p>• Properties of the post-disaster and duration of threat </p><p>• Environment (temperature, humidity, pollution…) </p><p><b>Host Related Factors</b> </p><p>Although specific factors intensify reactions, there are personal risk factors that people often possess prior to the disaster/emergency that make them more vulnerable to disaster-precipitated stress. People often have preexisting stress prior to the disaster/emergency. This stress makes them more vulnerable to the challenges that a disaster/emergency situation brings. </p><p><b>Health </b></p><p>• Disabled: physical, sight, hearing, speech </p><p>• Health and medical problems, receiving medication </p><p><b>Social </b></p><p>• Lack of support networks, divorced, widowed </p><p>• Cultural: language barriers, norms and fears about receiving help in dealing with the system </p><p><b>Demographic </b></p><p>• Age: younger and older have more difficulties </p><p>• Sex: women report more stress than men but little differences have been found in immune and endocrine responses </p><p><b>Past History </b></p><p>• Past disaster experience/traumatic events </p><p>• Past mental illness or emotional problems </p><p><b>3.4. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF DISASTER </b></p><p><b>3.4.1. Sexual violence </b></p><p>Rape is increasingly recognized as a feature of internal wars, but it could as well be experienced in many different types of conflicts. In some conflicts, rape has been used systematically as an attempt to undermine the opposing groups. Rape, sexual violence, and exploitation may also be widespread in refugee camps, although the extent of its recognition is limited, widely varying estimates of the numbers of victims have been reported. </p><p>In addition to the long-lasting mental health disorders, rapes have resulted in the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). War and political conflict present high risk situations for the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV. There are various ways in which war predisposes to STI and HIV transmission, such as: </p><p>• widespread population movement, causing increased crowding; </p><p>• separation of women from partners normally providing protection; </p><p>• abuses and sexual demands by military personnel and others in positions of power; </p><p>• Weakened social structures, there by reducing inhibitions on aggressive behavior and violence against women. </p><p>Aside from these additional exposures, access to barrier contraceptives, to treatment for STIs, to the prerequisites for maintaining personal hygiene, and to health promotion advice are all compromised in conflict situations. </p><p>Human right violations: </p><p>Violations of human rights law and international humanitarian law that targets individuals can take many forms such as torture of civilian, physical and psychological harms to individuals do not end with the cessation of hostilities, sex trafficking, child labour, denying basic needs, etc. </p><p>The impact of disaster will also include indirect causes, such as food scarcity, population displacement, destruction of health facilities, and disruption of routine curative and preventive services. </p><p><b>3.4.2.</b> <b>Population Displacement </b></p><p>Population displacement due to environmental degradation is not a recent phenomenon. Historically, people have had to move from their land because it had been degraded (through natural disasters, war or over-exploitation) and could not sustain them. What is more recent is the potential for mass movements caused by population growth, resource depletion and the irreversible destruction of the environment. Environmental disasters such as floods, droughts and earthquakes are displacing more and more people every year. People and governments of many nations are altering the physical environment in a way that makes it <i>more</i> vulnerable to disruption. For example, rapid rates of population growth and high levels of consumption in affluent states have resulted in the overutilisation and degradation of the land. As deforestation, desertification, global warming, and other threats appear, a new category of displaced people is being recognized - the environmentally displaced. </p><p>Mass population movement is due primarily to war, famine, drought or combination of these factors. Such migration predisposes large number to overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, malnutrition, and diseases for which they may not be immune. The highest morbidity and mortality rates occur in the mass displacements of populations in areas of limited resources during the acute phase of disaster. <b>Measles, diarrheal illness (eg. cholera)</b> and <b>acute upper respiratory infection</b> have emerged as the most common causes of infectious diseases - related deaths among refuge and internally displaced populations in 1990s. For example, Somalia and Rwanda provide the most devastating large scale mortality rates from infectious diseases in mass population displacements. In such situations, the crude death is inevitably higher in the refugee population than the base crude death rate of the host population. </p><p>In general, the variety of possible situations displaced persons may be experienced, in varying degrees, are summarized as follows: </p><p>• Loss of means of livelihood; </p><p>• Communities becoming separated from any services previously provided; </p><p>• Loss of normal sources of food; </p><p>• Lack of shelter and household necessities; </p><p>• Lack of fuel for cooking; </p><p>• Lack of potable water; </p><p>• Communicable diseases and overcrowding; </p><p>• Additional burdens particularly for women heads of households; </p><p>• Possibly large numbers of unaccompanied children; </p><p>• Loss of land tenure; </p><p>• Possible communication and logistics problems; </p><p>• Insecurity due to tension and military activities. </p><p><b>3.4.3. Communicable diseases </b></p><p>In general, the risks of large scale epidemics are low immediately following acute natural disasters, particularly in the developed world. </p><p>o Infectious disease outbreaks usually occur in the post impact and recovery phases and not during the acute phase. </p><p>o The risks of epidemics increase; however, if drought, famine, and large displacements of people are involved. These risks will be minimized if potable water; safe food; sanitation services including human and animal wastes removal; adequate personal hygiene; vector control; maintenance of routine immunization programs; sufficient space and ventilation in shelters and temporary housing; and the isolation of patients with communicable diseases are provided. </p><p><b>3.4.4. Climatic exposure </b></p><p>To a large extent, public health depends on safe drinking water, sufficient food, secure shelter, and good social conditions. A changing climate is likely to affect all of these conditions. Overall, however, the health effects of a rapidly changing climate are likely to be overwhelmingly negative, particularly in the poorest communities, which have contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions. Marked and short-term fluctuations in weather can cause acute adverse health effects; including the following: </p><p>• Extremes of both heat and cold can cause potentially fatal illnesses, e.g. heat stress or hypothermia, as well as increasing death rates from heart and respiratory diseases. </p><p>• In cities, stagnant weather conditions can trap both warm air and air pollutants -- leading to smog episodes with significant health impacts. </p><p>• These effects can be significant. For example abnormally high temperatures in Europe in the summer of 2003 were associated with at least 27,000 more deaths than the equivalent period in previous years. </p><p>Other weather extremes, such as heavy rains, floods, and hurricanes, also have severe impacts on health. Approximately 600,000 deaths occurred world-wide as a result of weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s; and some 95% of these were in poor countries. </p><p>• In October 1999, a cyclone in Orissa, India, caused 10,000 deaths. The total number of people affected was estimated at 10-15 million; </p><p>• In December 1999, floods in and around Caracas, Venezuela, killed approximately 30,000 people, many in shanty towns on exposed slopes. </p><p>Measurement of health effects from climate change can only be very approximate. Nevertheless, a WHO quantitative assessment, taking into account only a subset of the possible health impacts, concluded that the effects of the climate change that has occurred since the mid-1970s may have caused over 150,000 deaths in 2000. It also concluded that these impacts are likely to increase in the future. </p><p><b>3.4.5. Food shortage and malnutrition </b></p><p>Famine and decreased per-capita food production in general can result from natural disasters (e.g. extensive flooding, prolonged drought, or gradual change in climate) or armed conflicts. In fact, in conflict areas food procurement and distribution have been used as a weapon of war. In Africa, drought permanently threatens 460 million people (see figure 5 below). </p><p><b>Figure 7 Drought Prone Countries in Africa </b></p><p><b>3.4.6. Mental Health: </b></p><p><b>Post traumatic stress disorder: </b></p><p>Each disaster presents a slightly different profile of emotional trauma. However, some trends are predictable. All persons involved </p><p>Key: </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Drought Prone are\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Non-drprone a</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>with a disaster will suffer to some degree from the emotional trauma. Human-created disasters seem to cause a more intense reaction than those of natural occurrence. The most consistent positive predictor of significant symptoms is the degree of direct involvement in the disaster. </p><p><b>Risk factors for post traumatic stress disorder development after disaster: </b></p><p>• intense exposure to death and injury; </p><p>• exposure of survivors to dead bodies; </p><p>• overwhelming life threatening danger; </p><p>• unexpected or first exposure to disaster; </p><p>• intense initial phase (prolonged stress); </p><p>• manmade disaster with no warning; </p><p>• high impact ratios; </p><p>• dependence on outside agencies; </p><p>• exposure to prolonged stress. </p><p><b>Time course of post traumatic stress disorder: </b></p><p>The development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be delayed from one week to three years, and it is divided into three stages. </p><p>• <b>Stage one</b> is associated with an adrenergic surge that occurs acutely, but persons rarely dwell long term on the incident. It may last up to one month, and, if symptoms last more than six weeks, the patients are considered to have been entered stage two. </p><p>• <b>Stage two</b> is characterized by a sense of helplessness and a loss of self-control. Autonomic and somatic manifestations dominate. Moreover, it is accompanied by lifestyle and personality changes. </p><p>• <b>Stage three</b> is characterized by profound despondency and demoralization. </p><p><b>Prognosis: </b></p><p>Overall, the majority (70% to 90%) of the patients with PTSD will do well: 30% rapidly, 40 % manifest mild symptoms, 20% manifest moderate symptoms, 10% don\'t recover or get worse. Patients with a good prognosis are those with a rapid onset and a short duration of symptoms. These people usually have strong social net work, and usually they have participated in one form of formal process of trying to resolve the emotional content of an incident in order to prevent PTSD. </p><p><b>3.4.6.1. Children in disasters: </b></p><p>The actual degree of emotional trauma among children is usually underestimated after disaster. The most important reasons for this are: </p><p>• Most studies to date have had significant methodological flaws. </p><p>• Parents are either unaware or unwilling to admit any inability to protect their children from stress, and therefore they under report it. </p><p>• The extrapolation of emotional status from non-disaster events to disaster may also give false evaluation of the level of the symptoms in children. </p><p>• Most of the childhood emotional effects of disaster are age-related. </p><p>The impact of disaster on children should be thought of in terms of their developmental age and not their <b>chronologic age</b>. Preschoolers are still exercising some normal separation anxiety. Disaster will increase the normal feelings. <i>Increased arousal, sleep disturbances, clinging and fear of being alone all become manifest</i>. School-age children tend to be less dependent on their parents. As such their response to the stress of a disaster may be less consistent. They may exhibit reckless behavior and may experience psychosomatic complaints. Adolescents, who are independent, often become involved in productive activities, such as rescue and recovery work. Some; however, may regress and may display withdrawn functioning under significant denial. Normal adolescent anxiety may be increased particularly if they identify with the victims. </p><p><b>Risk factors of an increased emotional trauma in children: </b></p><p>• high intensity event; </p><p>• injury to the child; </p><p>• loss of parent or significant person; </p><p>• fear of death, separation and recurrence of the disaster; </p><p>• insecurity, lack of support; </p><p><b>3.4.6.2. The elderly in disasters: </b></p><p>The elderly are indeed at an increased risk for physical injury in some circumstances, but they are not necessarily at an increased risk for psycho emotional disorder. However, the impact of the loss of spouse, relative, or even a pet may be greater in the elderly. Another factor is the loss of self-reliance. In some cases the disruption of normal routines and living environment may result in confusion and aberrant behavior. However, the life experience of the elderly may be a valuable resource during the recovery phase of the disaster. They often have more realistic expectations of what their recovery needs are. </p><p><b>Treatment: </b></p><p>Mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, and psychologists, are regarded as the principal providers of care to the PTSD patients. Psychotherapy and behavioral therapy are generally thought necessary, and they have yielded good results, in addition, some patients may benefit from psychotropic medications. </p><p><b>3.4.6.3. Rescue workers in disaster: </b></p><p>The most common secondary victims of a disaster are those providing care to the victims. These include not only rescue and search personnel but also physicians, nurses and other staff. The stress reactions seen in non-professionals involved in disaster response resemble the symptoms seen in primary victims. Many professional responders also report serious symptoms following disaster. Rescue workers will have more intense emotional trauma if they are involved in a failed rescue attempts (especially if children are involved). However, up to 90% of the professionals involved will have good coping skills. </p><p>The most serious reactions occur among rescue workers involved with body handling. These are due to in part the profound sensory stimulation experienced by these personnel. Inexperienced body handlers have significantly more symptoms than those with previous experience. Symptoms can also be correlated with number of bodies encountered by the rescue worker </p><p><b>Additional symptoms of PTSD in professional disaster worker are decreased by: </b></p><p>• ability to judge risk; </p><p>• leadership ability; </p><p>• efficiency; </p><p>• ability to work cooperatively. </p><p><b>Factors for decreasing PTSD symptoms in disaster workers are: </b></p><p>• prior disaster training; </p><p>• specific disaster education; </p><p>• maturity; </p><p>• experience with prior disasters; </p><p>• Leadership type (good leadership). </p><p><b>Coping methods for disaster recovery workers include: </b></p><p>• To avoid humanization of the bodies; </p><p>• not to look at the faces; </p><p>• not to learn the name of the victims; </p><p>• to concentrate on the tasks at hand; </p><p>• to concentrate on the benefit to the society. </p><p>In disaster people loose loved ones, relatives and property. Above all, in psychological terms, they lose faith - not religious faith, but faith in the fact that life has a certain consistency and meaning. </p><p><b>3.4.7. Five experiences borne by survivors are: </b></p><p>• <b>The death imprint</b>: it consists of indelible imaginary of the encounter with death, intruding whilst awake, or during sleep in the form of nightmares. It comprises considerations of experience - images of the impact such as the sight of bodies dismembered or crushed, the sounds of screaming, or the smell of burning flesh. </p><p>• <b>Survivor guilt</b>: when the person questions why they survived when other did not, can be of two sorts: </p><p>o There is what might be called "existential guilt". Here, the person dwells in a very general way on their survival - \'why me?\' or \'why did God choose me?\' perhaps, \'why me when I am old and so many children died?\' </p><p>o Guilt may be focused on actions or their absence - \'Did I do enough, could I have saved more people? Guilt may be especially intense when parents survive their children, or where there is competition for survival. </p><p>• <b>Psychic numbing</b><i>:</i> it is manoeuvre, presenting survivors from experiencing the reality of the catastrophic destruction and death about them, and the massive personal threat implied.<i> </i></p><p>o It blocks the experience of too much unbearable pain at any time, and its first manifestations are present in the so called \'disaster syndrome\', where immediately following the impact, behaving remarkable calmly. </p><p>o They may seem to be in control and coping bravely </p><p>- in fact, they have not yet to react. They are behaving as though they are calm observers of someone else\'s experience. </p><p>• <b>Nurturance conflicts</b>: refers to suspicion of offers from outsiders and in particular to the experience of distrust, the fear that such offers may be false. </p><p>o Survivors may become \'touchy and sensitive to the response of others\'. </p><p>o Develop \'a form of severe victim-consciousness\' which sometimes reaches the level of paranoia. </p><p>• <b>Quest for meaning</b>: the survivors need to make a \'formulation\' of their experience in the attempt to explain and gain mastery over it. Formulation is a key element of psychological processing and hence of much psychological treatment of trauma. The survivors\' search to understand the experience of the disaster exists on a number of levels, which might be termed as \'hierarchy of formulation\'. In terms of development of understanding over time, a psychological sequence might be: </p><p>Mutual assistance and disaster intervention programs may significantly limit the impact of disaster on the community. International assistance is difficult to manage and coordinate but may make a decisive difference in the outcome, especially in countries and areas with very limited resources. </p><p><b>3.5. Development and Disasters </b></p><p>For a long time the cause and effect relationship between disasters and social and economic development was ignored. Development planners hoped that disasters would not occur and, if they did, were most effectively handled by relief from donor countries and relief organizations. Disasters were seen in the context of emergency response-not as a part of long term development programming. When a disaster did occur, the response was directed to emergency needs and cleaning up. </p><p>The growing body of knowledge on the relationships between disasters and development indicates four basic themes. The themes may be expanded as follows: </p><p>• Disasters set back development programming, destroying years of development initiatives. </p><p>• Rebuilding after a disaster provides significant opportunities to initiate development programs. </p><p>• Development programs can increase a particular area\'s susceptibility to disasters. A major increase in livestock development leads to overgrazing, which contributes to desertification and increased vulnerability to famine. </p><p>• Development programs can be designed to decrease susceptibility to disasters and their negative consequences. Housing projects constructed under building codes designed to withstand high winds result in less destruction during the next tropical storm. </p><p><b>3.5.1 Disruption of Development by Disasters</b>: </p><p>Disasters can seriously disrupt development initiatives in several ways, including: </p><p>• Loss of resources </p><p>• Interruption of programs </p><p>• Impact on investment </p><p>• Impact on the non-formal sector </p><p>• Political destabilization </p><p><b>Loss of Resources: </b>Development resources are lost when a disaster wipes out the products of investment. It shortens the life of development investments. </p><p><b>Interruption of Programs: </b>Disasters interrupt ongoing programs and divert resources from originally planned uses. </p><p><b>Impact on Investment Climate: </b>Investors need a climate of stability and certainty to be encouraged not to risk their money. <b> </b></p><p><b>Impact on Non-Formal Sector: </b>Disasters depress the non-formal economy through the direct costs of lost equipment and housing (which often also serves as business sites). The indirect costs of disasters include lost employment, and lost income. Sometimes the importation of relief items creates disincentives to producers. </p><p><b>Political Destabilization: </b>The stress to a country caused by a disaster often results in the destabilization of the government. This may occur for several reasons. For example, mismanagement of the disaster relief and recovery, or the survivors may have had unmet expectations. </p><p><b>3.5.2 How Development May Cause Disasters </b></p><p>Development projects implemented without taking into account existing environmental hazards may increase vulnerability to natural disasters. For example, projects designed to increase employment opportunities, and thus income, usually attract additional population growth. Low-income people may then have to seek housing in areas previously avoided, on hillsides or in floodplains. The cost of relief assistance after a landslide or flood can easily outweigh the benefits to the economy of more jobs. Similarly, development projects may lead to negative political consequences that increase the vulnerability to civil conflict. </p><p><b>3.5.3 Development opportunities afforded by disasters </b></p><p>Disaster can serve as a catalyst for introducing mitigation activities. Disasters often create a political and economic atmosphere wherein extensive changes can be made more rapidly than under normal circumstances. For example, in the aftermath of a disaster, there may be major opportunities to <b>execute land reform programs</b>, to <b>improve the overall housing stock</b>, to <b>create new jobs and job skills</b>, and to <b>expand and modernize the economic base </b>of the community - opportunities that would not otherwise be possible. </p><p>Disasters can also highlight high-risk areas where action must be taken before another disaster strikes. The realization of vulnerability can motivate policy-makers and the public to participate in mitigation activities. Disasters may also serve to highlight the fact that the country is seriously under-developed. They can thus bring in funding and the attention of donor communities to apply to long-term development needs (Henderson, 1990). </p><p><b>Exercises: </b></p><p>1.

These activities are categorized as disaster preparedness, disaster response, disaster recovery, post disaster epidemiological surveillance, environmental management and disaster mitigation. The details of these activities are treated in the subsequent sections of this chapter. </p><p><b>Aims of disaster management are to: </b></p><p>• Reduce (avoid, if possible) the potential losses from hazards; </p><p>• Assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims when necessary; </p><p>• Achieve rapid and durable recovery. </p><p><b>4.2</b> <b>Disaster preparedness</b> </p><p>Disaster preparedness is defined as a <b>state of readiness to respond to a disaster</b>, crisis, or any other type of emergency situation. More broadly it is stated as the leadership, training, readiness and exercise support, and technical and financial assistance to strengthen citizens, communities, state, local and tribal governments professional emergency workers as they prepare for disaster, mitigate the effects of disaster, respond to community needs after a disaster, and launch effective recovery efforts (www.fema.gov). </p><p>All measures and policies taken before an event occurs that allow for prevention, mitigation, and readiness constitutes disaster preparedness. <b>Preparedness</b> includes designing warning systems, planning for evacuation, and reallocation, storing food and water, building temporary shelters, devising management strategies, and holding disaster drills and exercises,. <b>Contingency planning</b> is also included in preparedness as well as planning for post-impact response and recovery. </p><p>The aim of disaster preparation is to be able to reduce the immediate mortality and morbidity with a better prepared, well equipped service. The preparation includes <i>early warning systems for seasonal changes in climate</i>, and risk of flood or drought, such as electronic information systems and satellites that can provide information over large regions and continents. Separate systems are needed to cater for the agricultural sector, cities and people in rural or remote communities. The <i>public health infrastructure</i> is particularly important for the immediate measures needed and for public information on reducing the health risks. </p><p>The most important challenge is to change from concentrating solely on post-disaster relief and to <b>focus on pre-disaster preparedness</b>. Thanks to disaster-preparedness schemes, particularly to an increasingly sophisticated early warning system, the comparative losses of life due to weather-related disasters are declining. All the evidence shows that, for every dollar spent on prevention and preparedness, about $100 or more is needed for relief efforts after the disaster has taken place. </p><p>Where such forecasting and warning systems are installed as part of disaster-management programs, evidence shows that more lives can be saved and damage is drastically reduced </p><p>Being prepared also means having thorough disaster contingency plans comprising of: </p><p>• Covering emergency housing, repairs, replacement of essential equipment and protection of the most vulnerable people in the community: <b>the sick, the very young and the old. </b></p><p>• Improvement of <i>water supply</i> and <i>sanitation systems </i></p><p>• <i>Logistics </i>of the predicted need for health and social services need to be laid down in advance, including <i>early warning systems to detect health effects</i>. </p><p>• <i>Planning for climate change</i>: as global warming and its effects on water will increase the frequency of water related disasters. </p><p>• <i>Public information and education</i>: to ensure early warnings to communities at risk; and give information about how to conserve water and keep it safe from contamination. </p><p><b>Preparedness</b> consists of three basic steps: <b>preparing a plan</b>, <b>training to the plan</b>, and <b>exercising the plan</b>. Preparedness deals with the functional aspects of emergency management such as the response to and recovery from a disaster, whereas <b>mitigation</b> attempts to lessen these effects through pre-disaster actions as simple as striving to create "disaster-resistant" communities. </p><p><b>Planning for various disasters:</b> </p><p>Two strategies for disaster planning include the <b>agent-specific</b> and <b>the all-hazards approaches</b>. In agent-specific planning, communities only plan for threats most likely to occur in their region. Since many disasters pose similar problems and similar tasks, an all-hazards approach involves planning for the common problems and tasks that arise in the majority of disasters. </p><p> </p><p>Figure 8 Phases of Disaster Management <b> </b></p><p>The following are some of the means to plan for disastrous situations: </p><p>• Escape routes </p><p>• Family communications </p><p>• Utility shut-off and safety </p><p>• Insurance and vital records </p><p>• Special needs </p><p>• Safety Skills </p><p><b>Escape Routes </b></p><p>Identify and prepare escape routes such as alternative doors, windows, and path ways. </p><p><b>Family Communications </b></p><p>It is important to contact police departments, Red-Cross, radio/Television (media) stations to find family members. Pick also a friend or relative who lives out-of- woredas, zone, and region for household members to notify that they are safe. </p><p><b>Utility Shut-off and Safety </b></p><p>In the event of a disaster, you may be instructed to shut off the utility service at your home. Below is some general guidance for shutting off utility service: </p><p><b>Natural Gas</b>: Natural gas leaks and explosions are responsible for a significant number of fires following disasters. It is vital that all household members (who have natural gas) know how to shut off natural gas. </p><p><b>Water:</b> Water quickly becomes a precious resource following many disasters. It is vital that all household members (who have water pipe lie) learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve. </p><p>• Cracked lines may pollute the water supply to your house. It is wise to shut off your water until you hear from authorities that it is safe for drinking. </p><p><b>Electricity: </b>Electrical sparks have the potential of igniting natural gas if it is leaking. It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity. </p><p>Preparing to Shut Off Electricity </p><p>• Locate your electricity circuit box. </p><p>• Teach all responsible household members how to shut off the electricity to the entire house. </p><p>For Your Safety: always shut off all the individual circuits before shutting off the main circuit breaker. </p><p><b>Insurance and vital records: </b></p><p>Households should be encouraged to have insurance for property, health and life. Such vital records, including insurance, bank… books need to be kept in safe place. </p><p><b>Planning for Special Needs </b></p><p>If you have special needs, find out about special assistance that may be available in your community. </p><p>• Create a network of neighbors, relatives, friends, and coworkers to aid you in an emergency. Discuss your needs and make sure everyone knows how to operate necessary equipment. </p><p>• Discuss your needs with your employer. </p><p>• If you are mobility impaired and live or work in a high-rise building, have an escape chair. </p><p>• If you live in an apartment building, ask the management to mark accessible exits clearly and to make arrangements to help you leave the building. </p><p>• Keep specialized items ready, including extra wheelchair batteries, oxygen, catheters, medication, food for service animals, and any other items you might need. </p><p>• Be sure to make provisions for medications that require refrigeration. </p><p>• Keep a list of the type and model numbers of the medical devices you require. </p><p>Additionally, under each specific disaster, the necessary preparedness to be made is discussed accordingly and readers are advised to refer to chapter two for more information regarding specific disaster. </p><p><b>4.3 Disaster Response </b></p><p>Response is the immediate reaction to disaster. It may occur as the disaster is anticipated, as well as soon after it begins. Examples include <b>mass evacuation</b>, <b>sandbagging buildings and other structures</b>, <b>securing emergency food and water</b>, <b>covering windows</b>, <b>providing emergency medical services</b>, search and rescue, firefighting, and restoring public order to prevent looting. </p><p><b>Extrication, triage, stabilization, and transport</b> </p><p><b>Extrication</b> has evolved into a fire services function in most of the country. In addition to specialized technical and trench rescue teams, fire services have more experience with building collapse and secondary hazards (eg, floods, fires) than other organizations. </p><p>The concept of <b>triage</b> involves providing the most help for as many as possible. Medical personnel are accustomed to providing extensive, definitive care to every patient. When confronted by a number of patients simultaneously in a disaster situation, it is easy to become overwhelmed, even for an experienced disaster worker. Triage must occur at multiple levels, and patients must be reassessed during every step of the process. </p><p><b>Transport</b> must be both organized and orchestrated. </p><p><b>Definitive scene management </b> </p><p>While scene control and containment may be relatively simple in a local, static disaster, dynamic and paralytic disasters may take several days to contain and stabilize. As the length of time of the disaster increases, additional resources must be made available, as rescue crews reach exhaustion, supplies become spent, and additional hazards develop. </p><p>There is often theoretical debate over when the response function ends and recovery function begins. For the time being, the response function is classified as the immediate actions to save lives, protect properties, and meet basic human needs. </p><p><b>Activation </b></p><p><b>Notification and initial response: </b>During this phase, organizations involved in disaster response and the potentially affected populations are notified. </p><p><b>Organization of command and scene assessment: </b>The prearranged command and staff structure for responding to the disaster should be arranged and initial communications nets established. </p><p><b>Emergency Response Activities:</b><b><i> </i></b></p><p>Emergency response activities are those carried out during the actual emergency or immediately prior to it. This may involve evacuation of threatened communities, emergency assistance during the disaster, and actions taken in the immediate aftermath during the time when the community is rather disorganized and basic services and infrastructure are not fully functioning. Because the emergency period is both dramatic and traumatic, most attention by the press and international community is focused here. Yet in most disasters (with the exception of droughts and civil strife), the emergency passes rather quickly and, in reality, only accounts for a very small percentage of the total picture. </p><p>Twelve tasks or problems are likely to occur in most disasters are summarized below: </p><p>• <i>Interorganizational coordination is</i> important. </p><p>• <i>Sharing information among organizations</i>, </p><p>• <i>Resource management</i>, </p><p>• When advance <i>warnings</i> are possible, <i>evaluations</i> from areas of danger can be the most effective life-saving strategy in disaster. </p><p>• The public tends to underestimate risks and downplays <i>warnings</i> if messages are ambiguous or inconsistent. </p><p>• <i>Search and rescue</i> </p><p>• <i>Using the mass media</i>: to deliver warnings to the public and to educate the public </p><p>• <i>Triage</i>: is a method of assigning priority for treatment and transport for injured citizens. </p><p>• <i>Casualty distribution</i>: in most domestic disasters, several medical resources can handle the casualty distribution. </p><p>• <i>Patient tracking</i>: is complicated by the fact that most persons evacuating their homes do not seek lodging in public shelters where their presence will be registered. </p><p>• <i>Caring for patients when the health care infrastructure has been damaged</i> <i>requires careful advance planning</i>. </p><p>• <i>The management of volunteers and donations</i>: is a common problem in disasters. Procedures should be established to manage large number of resources. </p><p>• <i>Plan for organized improvement in response to the disruption of shelter, utilities, communication systems, and transportation. </i> </p><p><b>4.4. Declaration of disaster: </b></p><p>The social disorganization surrounding a disaster and the number and types of responding organizations and groups create the need for a well-ordered mass response system. Consequently, a complex organizational environment has to be developed to respond in disaster situations. To mobilize these organizations, <b>a declaration of disaster is initiated</b> according to an increasing level of emergency (disaster). </p><p>Disaster shall be declared when convincing and complete socioeconomic reports from regional councils and the National Early </p><p>Warning System are provided. National level declaration for disaster will be made only by the National Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Committee (NDPPC). The commencement of relief measures shall automatically follow the declaration of disaster in the area. However, it is not always necessary to wait such formal declaration, or NDPPC\'s decisions on measures to be taken. Having regard to the policies of the Government, relief operation may commence with the available local resource before a formal declaration if the state of distress warrants immediate intervention. Subject to its enforcement by NDPPC and depending on the context of the disaster, the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) may also authorize certain essential measures to be taken in such situations. </p><p><b>4.5. Disaster Recovery (Rehabilitation and Reconstruction): </b> </p><p>The primary aim of recovery is to assist the affected community to regain a proper level of functioning following a disaster both initially and in the long term. It is "the coordinated process of supporting emergency-affected communities in reconstruction of the physical infrastructure and restoration of emotional, social, and physical well-being" (Emergency Management Australia, 2004). Recovery essentially concerns rehabilitation as well as developing the tools to mitigate against the future impact of a disaster, and should return the community to an improved state of post-disaster. This includes those activities that continue beyond the emergency period to restore lifelines. Examples include providing temporary shelters, restoring power, critical stress debriefing for emergency responders and victims, job assistance, small business loans, and debris clearance. </p><p>Recovery involves decisions and actions relative to rebuilding homes, replacing property, resuming employment, restoring business, and permanently repairing and rebuilding infrastructures. Since the recovery function has such long-lasting effects and usually high costs, the participants in the process are numerous. They include all levels of government, the business community, political leadership, community activists and individuals. </p><p>The recovery phase is frequently underemphasized in disaster plans, but it is crucial for the affected community. Recovery efforts should identify opportunities for community development, especially in terms of creating sustainable, safer, and more resilient communities. </p><p>The four elements of recovery are: </p><p>1. Community recovery (including psychological recovery); 2. Infrastructure recovery (services and lifelines); </p><p>3. Economy recovery (including financial and political considerations, and business continuity); 4. Environment recovery. </p><p>1. Community recovery: </p><p>• Have we considered the specific needs of our community? That is, the cultures, traditions, demographics, etc as identified. </p><p>• What mechanisms and resources will be required to aid in the psychological recovery of the community? </p><p>• What financial assistance is available to the community? For example, government payments and public appeals. </p><p>• What government and non-government agencies would you consider necessary to rebuild your community following disaster? </p><p>• What are likely to be the medical and health requirements of the community? </p><p>2. Infrastructure recovery: </p><p>• How will we ensure the restoration of essential services? </p><p>• How will our community access essential services? </p><p>• How will we ensure or facilitate restoration of living conditions and housing security? </p><p>• How will we rebuild our community infrastructure? This includes ports, airports, dry storage, roads, public transport, fuel, gas, water, electricity, telecommunications, garbage and sewerage, waterways, parks, flora and fauna. </p><p>• How will we communicate with our community and external agencies? This includes gathering, processing and circulating information to and from the community. It also encompasses communication with disaster workers (staff and volunteers), media, local government management, suppliers, groups and authorities including the local disaster management group. </p><p>• Are our recovery plans adequately integrated and/or considerate of plans of other relevant services (such as health, energy, telecommunications, etc)? </p><p>3. Economic recovery: </p><p>• What impact will disaster have on job security in our community? (that is, both for displaced community members and volunteers in the recovery process.) </p><p>• What mechanisms and resources will be required to assist and ensure the economic recovery of the community? </p><p>• Who needs to be involved in re-establishing economic validity in our community? </p><p>4. Environmental recovery: </p><p>• What issues do we need to consider in preparing for and managing environmental damage caused by a disaster event? </p><p>• Who needs to be involved in this process? </p><p><b>Principles of disaster recovery and reconstruction: </b></p><p>Three phases describe as to what happens to post-impact in the affected community: </p><p>1. <i>Emergency phase</i>: activities should focus on saving lives through search and rescue, first aid, emergency medical assistance and over all disaster assessment. Efforts immediately begin to repair critical facilities, to restore communications, and transportation networks, and in some cases, to evacuate residents from areas still vulnerable to further disaster. </p><p>2. <i>Transition or recovery phase</i>: during this phase, people return to work, repair damaged buildings and infrastructure, and initiate other actions that allow the community to return to their normal as soon as possible. Victims begin emotional recovery and may experience depression and post-traumatic disorder. 3. <i>Reconstruction phase</i>: is characterized by physical reordering of communications, utilities, roads and general environment. Residents repair or rebuild their housing and agricultural activities resume. </p><p>Community participation is essential for planning the rehabilitation phase because local people better understand their own needs and the problems that create these needs. </p><p><b>4.6 Disaster mitigation </b></p><p><b>Mitigation </b>is defined as a sustained action to reduce or eliminate risk to people and property from hazards (disasters) and their effects. The function of mitigation differs from other emergency management disciplines since <b>it looks at long-term solutions</b> to reduce risk as opposed to preparedness for hazards, the immediate response to hazards, or the short-term recovery from a hazard event. </p><p>Disaster mitigation includes those activities designed to prevent or reduce losses from disaster. It is usually considered the initial phase of emergency management, although it may be a component in the other phases. Examples include <b>land-use planning</b>, to limit or prevent development in floodplains, <b>building codes to reduce losses from earthquakes</b> and fires, dam and levees to prevent flooding. </p><p>The mitigation efforts must include: </p><p>• <i>Emergency housing, </i>especially after floods, but also if drought has caused mass population movement in an attempt to find better water and food supplies. </p><p>• Provision of <i>emergency supplies of safe drinking water.</i> </p><p>• <i>Emergency repairs to homes, drains and water supply and sanitation infrastructure.</i> </p><p>• <i>Early warning systems</i> <i>to identify health effects</i> and to detect rise in mosquito borne diseases, such as malaria, and diarrheal diseases, such as cholera. </p><p>Both disaster preparedness and its mitigation require multisectoral cooperation and joint planning. Both need evaluation after a disaster to reduce the ill effects of later crises. </p><p>The goal of mitigation is to <b>create economically secure, socially stable, better built, </b>and<b> more environmentally sound communities</b> that are out of harm\'s ways. The following widely accepted tools are used to reduce risks: </p><p>• Hazard identification and mapping, </p><p>• Design and construction applications </p><p>• Land-use planning, </p><p>• Finical incentives, </p><p>• Insurance, </p><p>• Structural controls. </p><p>In certain cases, some of the devastating effects of disasters can be reduced before the actual event. For example, evacuations may be orchestrated before hurricanes or floods. Early warning allows residents to seek shelter from tornadoes. </p><p><b>Disaster Mitigation Strategies</b><b> </b></p><p><b>Risk Identification </b></p><p>To reduce the threat of droughts and to lessen their impact should they occur, a number of measures can be taken. The first step in disaster mitigation is to identify areas that are at risk to drought. Once the priority zones have been identified, comprehensive and integrated rural development programs should be initiated. Among the usual activities are: </p><p>• Agricultural improvements including modifying cropping patterns and introduction of drought-resistant varieties of crops; </p><p>• Rangeland management including improvement of grazing lands, and grazing patterns, introduction of feedlots, and protection of shrubs and trees. </p><p>• Water resource development including improved irrigation, and water storage facilities, protection of surface water from evaporation, introduction of drip irrigation systems, and water containment methods such as retention dams and subsurface dams. </p><p>Animal husbandry activities including maintaining smaller herds, eliminating unproductive animals, and upgrading the quality and productivity of stock through improved breeding practices. </p><p><b>Land-Use Planning</b><b> </b></p><p>Another approach to reduce the impact of droughts on human settlements (including nomadic communities) is to employ land-use planning techniques. </p><p>Land-use controls similar to zoning regulations could be created and adopted by governing bodies. These controls can include: </p><p>• numbers of livestock per unit area; </p><p>• maximum population density; </p><p>• limits on amounts of water taken from public water supplies for agricultural or industrial use; </p><p>• authority to declare a state of emergency during which time animal herds are required to be depleted or transported to non-emergency areas, more stringent water usage allowances are imposed, etc. </p><p><b>Impediments to Mitigations </b></p><p>There are several factors, including denial of the risk, political will, cost and lack of funding. </p><p><b>4.7. Post disaster epidemiological surveillance: </b></p><p>Post-impact needs assessment provides information necessary to begin recovery. The first step is to <b>assess community capacities and vulnerabilities</b>, including physical environment (i.e. intact infrastructure, resources), social conditions (i.e. existing organizations, support, networks), and population attitude towards and motivation to recover. Communication must be established between the people affected by the disaster and the responding jurisdictions and organizations. Needs are determined by visiting representative areas, by talking to selected groups in affected communities, and by conducting rapid health assessment surveys. </p><p><b>Principles of the undertaking are to:</b><b> </b></p><p>• Maximize use of pre-existing surveillance data for "baseline" information, and to modify conditions </p><p>• Coordinate efforts after disaster with the normal surveillance activities in the health sector. </p><p>• Avoid duplication of efforts </p><p>• Be familiar with the epidemiology of endemic diseases and with the national surveillance system. </p><p>• Coordinate the relief surveillance of communicable disease with activities of national health authorities. </p><p>• Strengthen the reporting systems. </p><p>• Strengthen the documentation system at the central level, in hospitals and clinics at the intermediate level. </p><p><b>Steps in Epidemiologic Surveillance that should be taken before and after a Rapid-Onset Disaster </b></p><p>1. Identification of the diseases and other conditions to be monitored, and selection of suitable indicators. </p><p>2. Delineation of the areas affected by the disaster. </p><p>3. Rapid statistical sampling of sites (ideally including unaffected localities for control purposes). </p><p>4. Rapid, gross detection of cases or presumptive cases based on the presence of a symptom or complaint. </p><p>5. Monitoring and reporting by local health services of the selected diseases or symptoms. </p><p>6. Interpretation of data at the national level by a health unit of the disaster-affected country that is experienced in data analysis and has direct access to relief authorities. </p><p>7. Investigation of any "unusual" occurrence of disease by local health workers, assisted when necessary by epidemiologists. </p><p><b>Requirements</b><b> </b></p><p>For surveillance to be most effective, there are four requirements. </p><p>1. Establishment of priorities for investigating unusual occurrences of diseases, whether confirmed or rumored. </p><p>2. Establishment of a mechanism for dissemination of surveillance information to both encourage taking of appropriate measures and discourage expenditure on inappropriate measures. </p><p>3. Training and involvement of local health workers at all levels of the health system. </p><p>4. Pre-disaster planning, including identification of real health risks in various disaster situations, assignment of responsibilities, and development of an assessment and surveillance plan. </p><p><b>The Collection, Interpretation and Utilization of Data</b><b> </b></p><p>Participation of field health units in the surveillance system must be as complete as possible after a disaster. <b>It is critical to motivate reporting units</b>. The participation of units operating before the disaster should be continued when possible, with emphasis in reporting placed upon the diseases or symptom complexes targeted for surveillance. Health teams mobilized for the relief effort should be adequately briefed about the importance of surveillance. They should be given the case definitions to be used (according to IDSR) and be amply provided supplies of reporting forms. </p><p>Two operational aspects of data collection deserve emphasis. First is <b>the importance of regularly sending "negative" reports</b> whenever no patients with notifiable diseases are seen in a unit. A <b>report form with a line of zeros provides valuable information</b>. It also permits assessment of the number of units participating in the surveillance system. Failure to report, on the other hand, can either mean a lack of disease, or that a unit has dropped out of the surveillance effort. Speed of reporting is always critical in communicable disease surveillance and is especially vital following disaster. In general, <b>weekly reporting from all units by telephone</b>, telegraph or shortwave radio is preferable to reporting by mail. Immediate consultation about any unusual condition or suspected epidemic, at any time during the week, should be encouraged. </p><p>Innovative ways to facilitate rapid reporting during the period of severe disruption in transportation and communication should be sought by members of the epidemiology unit. Egs include: </p><p>• Daily or weekly radio reporting of selected diseases from the field; </p><p>• The distribution and retrieval of reporting forms by members of the drug and/or food distribution system; </p><p>• Gaining access to the national security force\'s communication network; </p><p>• Incorporating disease surveillance into a more general regular report required by the relief coordinator; </p><p>• Regular visit to field units by the epidemiologist-in-charge or a member of the surveillance team. </p><p>It is important that incoming notifications are evaluated immediately upon receipt by the epidemiology unit to provide prompt response to rumors or enquiries </p><p>The epidemiologists should also develop <b>maps and graphs </b>for<b> </b>visual appreciation of disease trends. This is frequently a more productive investment of the scarce time of staff members than is generating columns and figures. <b>Maps with pins indicating the geographic clustering of cases</b> are particularly useful for following the spread of a disease. Well charted graphs can more sensitively indicate disease trends than numbers. </p><p><b>Providing Feedback to the Field from the Central Level</b><b> </b></p><p>Providing feedback is an important aspect of post-disaster surveillance. The weekly report provides more than feedback to field workers. The epidemiologist should ensure that the weekly report and adequate background information (personal visit or covering note) are circulated to the relief coordinator and other national authorities and local representatives of voluntary agencies. The overall relief coordinator should be responsible for distributing the report to members of the media and the community. </p><p><b>Presenting Epidemiologic Information to Decision Makers</b><b> </b></p><p>It is critical to present information from surveillance and the field investigations to key decision makers. Epidemiologic information, implications and an outline of alternatives of action must be summarized in non-technical terms understandable to lay people. </p><p><b>Surveillance During and After the Recovery Phase</b><b> </b></p><p>With increasing passage of time after a disaster, both decision makers and the public become progressively less concerned with the probability of epidemic disease. The phasing out of the intensified, disaster-related surveillance activities should take place after consultation with members of the national epidemiology group. </p><p><b>4.8. Environmental health management </b></p><p>The impacts of disasters, whether natural or man-made, not only have human dimensions, but environmental ones as well. Environmental conditions may exacerbate the impact of a disaster, and vice versa, disasters have an impact on the environment. Deforestation, forest management practices, agriculture systems etc. can exacerbate the negative environmental impacts of a storm or typhoon, leading to landslides, flooding, silting and ground/surface water contamination. </p><p>Emphasizing and reinforcing the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster management has become a critical priority, requiring the sound management of natural resources as a tool to prevent disasters or lessen their impacts on people, their homes and livelihoods. </p><p>There is a clear need to reinforce the importance of environmental concerns in the entire disaster management cycle of <b>prevention, preparedness, assessment, mitigation </b>and <b>response </b>and to integrate environmental concerns into planning for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development. This will also require the enhancement of capacities to undertake short and medium-term activities in disaster management based on long-term environmental considerations. </p><p>Comprehensive understanding of natural systems coupled with the application of management tools such as environmental evaluation and risk assessment can make a major contribution to a reduction of risks and mitigation of any impacts. </p><p>Specifically, we need to examine the need for a multi-stakeholder partnership that links local governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations in order to facilitate more effective disaster prevention and mitigation. </p><p>Environment management is a critical strategy to prevent disasters, and reduce risks/vulnerabilities of disaster prone countries and communities. Disaster risks and vulnerability can be considerably reduced through effective and long-term environmental and natural resource management practices. </p><p><b>Exercises: </b></p><p>1.

The country has been drastically hit by and still is vulnerable to disasters due to various reasons such as low socio-economic development and hence inadequate action both to prevent and to respond to disasters. Among the frequent ones the following are worth mentioning: <b>famine, drought, forced displacement</b> (due to war, civil strives, political), <b>floods, landslides, fires, epidemics</b> (of human and animals), <b>pests</b> etc. Some of these will be discussed in detail as follows.<b> </b></p><p><b>5.2. Drought and Famine </b></p><p>The most serious impact of droughts can be the initiation of famine. Its importance warrants an in depth discussion. It should be regarded as a parallel disaster that will have parallel implications for <b>preparedness</b>, <b>mitigation</b>, and <b>relief activities</b>. </p><p>Drought affects more people than any other environmental hazard. Yet, it is perhaps the most complex and least understood type of all environmental hazards. Drought is often seen as too little rain and used to be synonymous with famine. However, fluctuation in rain fall does not cause a famine. Drought often triggers a crisis in the arid and semi-arid areas, since rain is sparse and irregular, but alone does not cause desertification. The ecosystem changes leading to desertification are all attributed to human activities, such as <b>over cultivation, deforestation, overgrazing, and unskilled irrigation</b>. Each of these activities is exacerbated by increasing human populations. The first three activities strip the soil of vegetation and deplete its organic substances and nutrient. </p><p>Famine is a disaster that occurs as the result of primarily drought, but it can also follow pestilence, windstorm, and human- induced catastrophes such as war and civil strife. Starvation is the result of food shortage. Famine and food emergencies are common events particularly in Africa, including Ethiopia and Asia, despite many intense and continuing efforts to address the problems. Drought-related famines appear to occur with cyclical frequency in many parts of Africa, both along the edges of deserts and in certain rain forest regions. </p><p>Famines rarely occur unexpectedly. Food stocks are not often depleted or destroyed suddenly and simultaneously in large communities. More frequently, famine is predictable. In other words, the creeping onset of crop failure or food emergency is predictable from a series of meteorological, agricultural, political and/or economic indicators that may be monitored continuously. This process of famine preparedness through surveillance is a major function of the Food &amp; Agriculture Organization (FAO) headquartered in Rome. Thus, it is extremely important that: </p><p>• indicators of an impending famine be closely monitored and measures taken quickly if it appears that a food shortage is developing; </p><p>• priority be given to developing strong food and agricultural systems that provide an adequate fall-back resource in threatened areas. </p><p>Regarding Ethiopia, most famines have concentrated geographically within two broad zones of the country. The first comprises of the central and northern high lands, stretching from northern previous <b>Shewa through Wollo and Tigray</b>. The second is made up of the crescent of low-lying, agro-pastoral lands ranging from <b>Wollo in the north, through Hararge and Bale to Sidamo and Gamo-Gofa in the south</b>. More than half of the crises of drought and famines have occurred in these two zones. </p><p>Ethiopia had previously suffered major drought and famine during the early 1970s. The late 1970s again brought signs of intensifying drought. By the early 1980s, large numbers of people in central Tigray, Wollo, and parts of Begemder (Gondar) and Shewa were beginning to feel the effects of renewed famine. </p><p>From 1982 to 1984, northern Ethiopia had no rain to water crops or for drinking. By mid-1984 it was evident that another drought and resulting famine of major proportions had begun to affect large parts of northern Ethiopia. The almost total failure of crops in the north was compounded by fighting in and around Eritrea, which hindered the passage of relief supplies. Although international relief organizations made a major effort to provide food to the affected areas, the persistence of drought and poor security conditions in the north resulted in continuing need as well as hazards for famine relief workers. </p><p>The 1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia was significant in the history of the country. Drought and political instability contributed to the severity of the famine, which was estimated to have <b>killed over one million people</b> and the remaining were destitute. The people were deprived of basic needs such as food, shelter, clothings, and medication. Many died as a result of starvation and from waterborne diseases. </p><p>Close to <b>8 million people became famine victims during the drought of 1984</b>, and over 1 million died. In late 1985, another year of drought was forecasted, and by early 1986 the famine spread to parts of the southern highlands, with an estimated 5.8 million people being dependent on relief food. Exacerbating the problem in 1986 were locust plagues. </p><p>The primary Government response to the drought and famine was the decision to <b>uproot large numbers of peasants who lived in </b><b>the affected areas </b>in the north and to resettle them in the southern part of the country. In 1985 and 1986, <b>about 600,000 people were moved, many forcibly, </b>from their home villages and farms by the military and transported to various regions in the south. Many peasants fled rather than allow themselves to be resettled; many of those who were resettled sought later to return to their native regions. Several human rights organizations claimed that tens of thousands of peasants died as a result of forced resettlement. </p><p>Another government plan involved <b>villagization,</b> which was a response not only to the famine, but also to the poor security situation. Beginning in 1985, peasants were forced to move their homesteads into planned villages, which were clustered around water, schools, medical services, and utility supply points to facilitate distribution of those services. Many peasants fled rather than acquiesce in relocation, which in general proved highly unpopular. Additionally, the government in most cases failed to provide the promised services. Instead of benefiting agricultural productivity, <b>the program caused a decline in food production</b>. Although temporarily suspended in 1986, villagization was subsequently resumed. </p><p>In 2003<b>, more than 12 million people were at risk of famine, </b>half of whom being children under 15 years of age. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of this crisis was that the famine persists despite generous outside food aid. Donations of wheat, soyabeans and oil can stave off much of the starvation in the short term, but they cannot keep hunger from returning year after year. </p><p>Drought is the primary reason Ethiopians go hungry, but it intertwines with other factors that keep Ethiopians too poor and too sick to recover from drought years. Rural Ethiopians have never fully recovered from the famine of 1984, nor the severe droughts that have come after, especially in 1999 and 2000. The impact of drought in Ethiopia is magnified by <b>the country\'s deforestation</b> and the <b>depletion of soil by farmers</b> who cannot afford to let land lie fallow. The effects of dry periods linger long after the rains return. </p><p>Drought reduces harvests and deprives livestock of water and pasture, forcing farmers and animal herders into a spiral of debt. Even if the rains are good, each year Ethiopians get hungrier. The long-term issue is poverty - famine hits those too destitute to buy food or produce their own. Fighting famine inside Ethiopia means providing not only emergency food, but also programs to help people emerge from the trap of destitution. Rural Ethiopians need more markets for their crops and better roads to be able to move their products to other parts of the country. Famine is not a sudden event, but an evolving process, one that involves much more than food. </p><p>Traditionally the Economy of Ethiopia is based on subsistence agriculture... Due to a number of causes, the peasants did not have incentives to either improve production or to store their excess harvest. Despite the extensive modernization of Ethiopia in the last 120 years, as of 2005 the overwhelming majority of the populations are still peasants who live from harvest to harvest, and are vulnerable to crop failures.

The drought affected 8.3 million people of the region. Heavy rainfall in April 2000 brought some relief, but the continuing conflict has restricted efforts to sort out the water supplies and sanitation in the region. The aid program includes the installation of water reservoirs and digging or repairing wells. Emergency repairs have been conducted by UNICEF, associated with the distribution of water treatment chemicals and jerry cans throughout the hardest hit areas. \'Donor fatigue\' and cynicism about the use of aid is a serious barrier to the international relief efforts to improve water supplies in the region. </p><p>Drought is related to climate and is relatively slow to develop. The primary public consequence of drought in developing countries, where food can\'t be easily imported, is <i>famine. </i>In addition, drought and famine may cause extensive, long-lasting social tensions because they act to deepen poverty very suddenly and divide society between those who can afford to get food at any price and those who cannot. Drought and famine are also associated with large population movements that complicate the task of providing medical care, food, and water to the affected communities. Thus, the combination of drought and famine is one type of natural disaster related to climate that has many of the worst characteristics of technological disasters. In general drought is characterized by the following features: </p><p>• A drought\'s onset and end are difficult to determine because the effects accumulate slowly and may linger even after the apparent termination of an episode; </p><p>• The absence of precise and universally accepted definition adds to the confusion about whether a drought exists, and if it does, the degree of severity; </p><p>• Drought effects are less obvious and spread over a larger geographic area. </p><p><b>Disaster Preparedness for famine and drought</b><b> </b></p><p>Several preparedness activities will decrease the impact of droughts on human settlements. Establishment of a monitoring system is very important. The first step in drought preparedness is to <b>establish a monitoring system to provide warning</b> if a drought is imminent. A monitoring system should be based on simple information that nontechnical observers can easily acquire and transmit. Such a system is usually based on indicators. Among the normal indicators of the onset of drought are: </p><p>• an unusual dry period; </p><p>• an increased number of wind storms; </p><p>• an increased number of dust storms; </p><p>• diminishing water supplies; </p><p>• an increase in the death rate of animals; </p><p>• changes in the migratory patterns of nomads; </p><p>• reduced price of animals; </p><p>• changes in vegetation, especially the introduction of desert plants such as scrub brushes; </p><p>• unusual changes in the prevalence rates of specific communicable diseases associated with personal and environmental hygiene, principally non-venereal skin diseases and diarrheal diseases, indicating the diminished use of water for washing. </p><p>Identify and stockpile seeds for <b>alternative drought-resistant crops</b>. Once drought begins, some attempts must be made to stimulate alternative agricultural activities. A number of crops can survive mild droughts. </p><p>Identify and stockpile feeds for cattle or other livestock. Losses can be greatly reduced if herds are penned up and fed in feedlots. This will save the animals, take pressure off the land, and let vegetation regenerate. </p><p>Determine human nutritional requirements and develop an on-site relief distribution plan. </p><p>Identify and select <b>appropriate action to fight desertification</b>. If desertification is a potential threat, measures should be taken to identify suitable approaches that could be employed to prevent the creation of deserts during a drought period. </p><p><b>5.3. Floods </b></p><p>• Flooding due to outburst of banks of Awash River, and over flow from Koka reservoir led to displacement of 40,000 people in Wonji and Metehara in1996. </p><p>• Wabishebele river flooding affected 100,000 people in Somali region in 2003. </p><p>• 260,000 were displaced and 170 died due to flooding from Wabe Shabelle, Hargeysa, Bilate, Ashewa, Genale, Dawa, Fafen, Sile and Sego rivers in months of April and June 2005. </p><p>• The worst scenario of flood in Ethiopia occurred in the summer of 2006 as the result of prolonged and intensive rainfall which resulted in flash floods and overflow of rivers and dams affecting 199,900 people in eight regions of Ethiopia, resulting in loss of lives, damage of property, and destruction of livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. According to the government and humanitarian partner flash appeal of the year 2006 preliminary document, a total of 635 people have been died (364 in South Omo, 256 in Dire Dawa and 19 in other parts of the country). <b> </b></p><p>Figure 8 Flood vulnerable areas and population at risk as of August 24, 2006. </p><p>The distribution affected and vulnerable population by region is shown in table 2 below. </p><p><b>Table 2 Distribution of Flood Vulnerable and Affected population of Ethiopia by administrative regions, September 2006 </b></p><p>The effects and distribution of the 2006 floods are summarized as follows:<b> </b></p><p>• <b>Dire Dawa: </b>the heavy rains from the high lands of East Hararge zone of Oromia regional State caused flash flood from the overflow of Dechatu dry season stream that severely affected Dire Dawa in the middle of the night on the six of August 2006, while residents were asleep where by it killed 256 and affected 9,000 people.

Role of Primary Health Care Unit Team in the event of Disaster </b></p><p>The three main objectives of public health response to a disaster are to <b>mitigate mortality and morbidity</b>, <b>restore the health status to pre-disaster levels</b>, and <b>establish a recovery process</b> that <i>will </i>promote health and a preparedness level to even beyond the pre-disaster condition. </p><p>Public health professionals must take responsibility for community health in both disaster preparedness and response. The following are some of the roles of public health: </p><p>• Identification of community resources applicable to the physical, social, and psychological effects of disaster; </p><p>• Identification of groups most at risk of disaster (children, older adults; homeless, chronically ill, homebound, physically or mentally disabled); </p><p>• Provision of disaster education both in advance of (i.e., what to expect in disaster) and after (i.e. how to deal with effects) event; </p><p>• Taking responsibility for the health of community following a disaster; </p><p>• Using such resources as assessment, epidemiology, and data analysis to make and implement recommendations for limiting morbidity and mortality following disaster; </p><p>• Cooperation and collaboration with colleagues in the health sector to ensure that primary health, public health, mental health, and social impacts are adequately addressed in disaster planning; </p><p>• Prevention of diseases by providing health advisories on injury prevention, food and water safety, and vector control; </p><p>• Assuring that health services continue post impact including acute, continuity of care, primary care and emergency care; </p><p>• Inspection of shelters and feeding operations; </p><p>• Requesting volunteers from appropriate agencies like Red Cross to supplement medical and nursing needs; </p><p>• Developing and advocating public policies designed to reduce the public health impact of potential disasters; </p><p>• Communicating with government officials about the public health effects of potential disasters and providing expert assistances during and after disasters; </p><p>• Collaborating with other health and human service professionals to rigorously evaluate the intervention outcome. </p><p>The responsibilities of public health agencies in disaster preparedness and response are more complicated than in a typical public health activity. In order to discharge the above duties and responsibilities the public health team should develop an action plan. </p><p><b>6.2 Action plan </b></p><p>The health sector is responsible for ensuring the continuity of health care services. Components of the plan may include: </p><p>o Ensuring continuity of health care services (by checking the availability and functionality of all necessary resources); </p><p>o Monitoring environmental infrastructure (water, sanitation, and vector control); </p><p>o Assessing the needs of the elderly and other especial populations; </p><p>o Initiating injury prevention programs and surveillance; </p><p>o Ensuring that essential public health sector facilities will be able to function post-impact </p><p>o Allocating resources to ensure that the above responsibilities can be accomplished. </p><p><b>6.3 Functional model of public health response </b></p><p>The functional model summarizes a typical disaster response within the public health field and categories the cycle of activities.

Introduction:\n\nDisasters and emergencies are fundamental reflections of normal life. They are consequences of the way society structure themselves, economically and socially; the way societies and states interact; and the way that relationships between the decision makers are sustained. The disaster emanates from the fact that certain communities or groups are forced to settle in areas susceptible to the impact of ranging river or a volcanic eruption. The magnitude of each disaster, be in terms of deaths, property damage or costs for a given developing country increases with the increment of marginalization of the population. As the population increases, the best land in both rural and urban areas is taken up, and those seeking land for farming or housing are forced to accept inadequate land. These offer less productivity and a smaller measure of physical or economic safety.\n\nDisasters have massive human and economic costs. They may cause many deaths, severe injuries, and food shortages. Most incidents of severe injuries and deaths occur during the time of impact, whereas disease outbreaks and food shortages often arise much later, depending on the nature and duration of the disaster. Anticipating the potential consequences of disasters can help determine the actions that need to be started before the disaster strikes to minimize its effects. This Chapter deals with definitions of disaster and other related terms like hazard, vulnerability and prevention. Moreover it also addresses types of disaster and discusses the trends of the occurrence of disasters to introduce readers the basic concepts of the subject matter.\n\n1.2. Definitions:\n\nDisaster: several definitions are frequently given to disaster. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a disaster as "a sudden ecological phenomenon of sufficient magnitude to require external assistance". It is also defined as any event, typically occurring suddenly, that causes damage, ecological disruption, loss of human life, deterioration of health and health services, and which exceeds the capacity of the affected community on a scale sufficient to require outside assistance (Landsman, 2001). It is an emergency of such severity and magnitude that the resultant combination of deaths, injuries, illness, and property damage cannot be effectively managed with routine procedures or resources.\n\nDisaster is further defined as an event in which a society or a community undergoes acute deprivation of food and other basic necessities due to natural and man made calamities to such an extent that the normal function of the society or the community is disrupted and that it cannot subsist without outside intervention (13).\n\nEmergency is a state in which normal procedures are suspended and extra-ordinary measures are taken in order to avert a disaster. An emergency can be defined in the context of the social, political and epidemiological circumstances in which it occurs.\n\nHazard is a rare or extreme event in the natural or human made environment that adversely affects human life, property or activity to the extent of causing a disaster. It is essential to make a distinction between hazards and disasters, and to recognize that the effect of the former upon the latter is essentially a measure of the society\'s vulnerability.\n\n(12)\n\nMitigation: is permanent reduction of the risk of a disaster. Primary mitigation refers to reducing the resistance of the hazard and reducing vulnerability. Secondary mitigation refers to reducing the effects of the hazard (preparedness).\n\nMitigation includes recognizing that disasters will occur; attempts are made to reduce the harmful effects of a disaster, and to limit their impact on human suffering and economic assets.\n\nPrevention is defined as those activities taken to prevent a natural phenomenon or potential hazard from having harmful effects on either people or economic assets. Delayed actions drain the economy and the resources for emergency response within a region. For developing nations, prevention is perhaps the most critical components in managing disasters, however, it is clearly one of the most difficult to promote. Prevention planning is based on two issues: hazard identification (identifying the actual threats facing a community) and vulnerability assessment (evaluating the risk and capacity of a community to handle the consequences of the disaster). Once these issues put in order of priority, emergency managers can determine the appropriate prevention strategies.\n\nDisaster prevention refers to measures taken to eliminate the root-causes that make people vulnerable to disaster (13).\n\nPreparedness: Are the measures that ensure the organized mobilization of personnel, funds, equipments, and supplies within a safe environment for effective relief.\n\nDisaster preparedness is building up of capacities before a disaster situation prevails inorder to reduce impacts. Its measures include inter alia, availability of food reserve, emergency reserve fund, seed reserve, health facilities, warning systems, logistical infrastructure, relief manual, and shelves of projects (13).\n\nReconstruction: the full resumption of socio-economic activities plus preventive measures.\n\nRehabilitation: is the restoration of basic social functions.\n\nResilience: is adaptability, capacity to recover.\n\nResponse: is the set of activities implemented after the impact of a disaster in order to assess the needs, reduce the suffering, limit the spread and the consequences of the disaster, open the way to rehabilitation.\n\nRisk is the expected losses (lives lost, persons injured, damages to property and disruption of economic activity) due to a particular hazard. Risk is the product of hazard and vulnerability.\n\nRisk is the probability that a person will experience an event in a specified period of time. Risk as a function of hazard and vulnerability, a relationship that is frequently illustrated with the following formula, although the association is not strictly arthematic: Risk = hazard x vulnerability.\n\nRisk is the probability of being affected by the unwanted consequences of a hazard. It combines the level of hazard and degree of vulnerability.\n\nRisk assessment is a term used widely for a systematic approach to characterizing the risks posed to individuals and populations by potentially adverse exposures.\n\nSusceptibility: is exposure to danger.\n\nVulnerability: is the degree of loss resulting from a potentially damaging phenomenon.\n\nIt is the susceptibility of a population to specific type of event. Vulnerability is also associated with the degree of possible or potential loss from a risk that results from a hazard at a given intensity. The factors that influence intensity include demographics, the age, and resilience of the environment, technology, social differentiation and diversity as well as regional and global economics and politics.\n\nIt is essential to make distinction between hazard and disaster. The presence of hazard by its self can neither cause risk nor disasters. There are different predisposing factors that make vulnerable the survivors. The following are some of such underlying causes:\n\n• Poverty: Virtually all disaster studies show that the wealthiest of the population survive the disaster, remains unaffected or are able to recover quickly.\n\n• Population growth: Increasing number of people will compete for limited amount of resources which can lead to conflict and conflict may result in crisis-induced migration.\n\n• Rapid urbanization: competition for scarce resources is an inevitable consequence of rapid urbanization, leading to human-made disasters.\n\n• Transitions in cultural practices: Societies are constantly changing and in continuous state of transition. These transitions are often extremely disruptive and uneven, leaving gaps in social coping mechanisms and technology. Conflicts as well as transitional cultural practices can also lead to civil conflict (e.g. communal violence triggered by religious differences).\n\n• Environmental degradation: Deforestation leads to rapid rain run off, which contributes to flooding.\n\n• Lack of awareness and information: Disasters can also happen because people vulnerable to them simply do not know how to get out of harm\'s way or to take protective measures.\n\n• Wars and civil strife are among the principal man made factors precipitating disaster.\n\nDisaster mainly occurs when vulnerability and hazard meet. The interaction and association of such phenomena is depicted in the following figure (Figure 1).\n\nFigure1: Relationship of vulnerability, hazard and disaster\n\nSource: WHO/EHA, 2002\n\n1.3. TYPES OF DISASTERS\n\nDisasters are broadly divided into two types comprising natural and man made (technological) disasters. There is also other basis by which disasters can be categorized which has been mentioned later in this section.\n\n1.3.1. Natural disasters\n\nNatural disasters occur as the result of action of the natural forces and tend to be accepted as unfortunate, but inevitable. The natural disasters result from forces of climate and geology. Natural disasters are perhaps the most "unexpected" and costly overall in terms of loss of human lives and resources. In the last few years, natural disasters have claimed 100,000 lives costing above 140 billion US dollars.\n\nDuring the 1980s, more than 700,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of severe weather, including floods and droughts. Natural disasters can be categorized as "acute" or "slow" in their onset. They should be predictable in certain instances since they cluster in geographical areas. Natural disasters with acute onsets include events such as earthquake, flood, hurricane, cyclone or typhoon, tornado, fire, tsunami or storm surge, avalanche, volcanic eruption, extreme cold or blizzard, and heat wave. Natural hazards with slow or gradual onset include drought, famine, desertification, deforestation, and pest infestation.\n\nThe 1990s and beyond proved to be even more calamitous, as global natural disaster trends rose with increasing rapidity (Figure 2). Among the different types of natural disasters, floods, tropical storms, droughts and earth-quakes are the most destructive, followed by landslides and storms.\n\nSource: Emergency Disasters Data Base, EM-DAT. (http://www.em-dat.net/)\n\nFigure 2: Global trends of natural disasters.\n\nIn 1992 alone, natural disasters costed the world economy more money than it spent on development aid. The November 2004 typhoons in the Philippines also claimed over 1,000 lives and devastated the livelihoods of many more. The recent Indian Ocean Tsunami was even more destructive that more than 150,000 lives were lost. As reported by the secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), the last ten years have seen 478,100 people killed, more than 2.5 billion people affected and about US$ 690 billion in economic losses. Disasters triggered by hydrometeorological hazards amounted for 97 percent of the total people affected by disasters, and 60 percent of the total economic losses (30).The damage and costs inflicted by natural disasters spread well beyond the immediate regions affected, to countries as a whole and often to the wider global community.\n\nThe incidence of hazards demonstrates considerable geographic variation. During the period 1994-2003, Asia was disproportionately affected by natural disasters (Figure 3). Approximately half of the 650 natural catastrophes recorded in 2004 were windstorms and severe weather events, while 80 were due to geological hazards (70 damaging earthquakes and 10 volcanic eruptions). As a result of increasingly effective preventive measures, while the number of disasters has more than tripled since the 1970s, the reported death toll has almost been reduced by half.\n\nSource: Emergency Disasters Data Base, EM-DAT. (http://www.em-dat.net/)\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of natural disasters by Region\n\nAround 75 percent of the world\'s population lives in areas affected at least once by earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or drought between 1980 and 2000. Billions of people in more than 100 countries are periodically exposed to at least one event of earthquake, tropical cyclone, flood or drought. As a result of disasters triggered by these natural hazards, more than 184 deaths per day are recorded in different parts of the world, 11 percent of the people exposed to natural hazards live in countries classified as having low human development, and they account for more than 53 percent of total recorded deaths7. For each hazard type, disaster risk is considerably lower in high-income countries than in medium- and low-income countries.\n\nFigure 4: Economic losses due to natural disasters 1960-2000 (million US$)\n\nNatural disasters can have significant economic and food security impacts, especially on the poorest households. In the last three decades, there has been a clear increase in the number of natural hazard events, the size of affected populations and the extent of economic losses (Figure 4). Several million victims have suffered homelessness, disaster induced ill health, severe economic losses and personal tragedies.\n\nDirect economic losses increased five times in the 1990s (Figure 4) and are mostly concentrated in the developed countries. Underlying these economic figures is not only the destruction of productive assets and vital infrastructure and the loss of livelihood systems but also their implication to economic development and poverty aggravation. When disasters occur, poor households suffer greater relative losses in terms of physical and social assets, resulting in deepening their poverty further. Such losses of assets can trap households in chronic poverty and food insecurity.\n\nAn important development in disaster management approaches over the past decade has been the recognition of their cyclical nature. Although the response phase captures most of the attention, much of the hard work on disaster risk management is carried out before disasters occur, in the form of risk assessment, prevention, mitigation, and establishing early warning systems. After the crisis has passed, the emphasis is on rehabilitation, reconstruction, and the commencement of a new cycle of assessment, incorporating lessons derived from the previous cycle.\n\n1.3.2. Human (technological) causes\n\nThe technological or manmade disasters result from some human activities, such as explosions, fires, the release of toxic chemicals or radioactive materials, bridge or building collapse, crashes, dam or levee failure, nuclear reactor accidents, breaks in water, gas, or sewer lines, deforestation, war, etc. Technological disasters tend to involve many more casualties than natural disasters of the same magnitude of energy release.\n\nTechnological or man-made disasters are unpredictable, can spread across geographical areas, may be unpreventable and may have limited physical damage but long-term effect. They are also much more difficult for the community to deal with and for victims to accept. In technological disasters, there are issues of blame involved and the community spends much time discussing who was responsible and what mistakes were made. Increasingly, agencies involved in disasters and their management are concerned with the interactions between man and nature, which can be complex and can aggravate disasters.\n\nCommunities in which industrial sites are located or through which hazardous material pass via high way, rail, or pipeline are at risk for technological disasters. Injuries can occur to workers at the site, to responders bringing the incident under control and providing emergency medical care, and to residents in the community. Those with pre-existing medical conditions, such as lung or heart diseases, could be at increased risk for negative health outcomes if exposed to toxic related skin disorders, and lung damage can result from exposure to specific agents.\n\nEnsuring that local industry implements basic safety procedures can significantly reduce negative health outcome from accidental release of toxins. Emergency preparedness - including the ability of pre- hospital and hospital systems to care for patients exposed to industrial agents, the training of medical personnel to work in contaminated environments, and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment for responders - is key for providing care following industrial accidents.\n\nAnother classification of disasters will be as follows:\n\n1. Sudden-onset disasters include floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, or tidal waves, tropical storms, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. As their name implies, sudden-onset disasters occur swiftly and often without any warning. Floods are the most frequent type of natural disaster associated with sudden migration of large populations and food shortages. Other types of disasters generally occur more frequently in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean rather than in Africa. When these disasters occur, they frequently cause thousands of deaths and casualties. Earthquakes cause the greatest number of deaths and overwhelming infrastructural damage. Communities at risk of these types of disasters should recognize and respond to threats posed by local weather patterns and the shape and contours of the land.\n\n2. Slow-onset disasters include droughts, famine, environmental degradation, deforestation (loss of trees and vegetation), pest infestation and desertification (conversion of arable lands to deserts). These disasters are usually the result of adverse weather conditions combined with poor land use. Traditionally, African communities, particularly the poor, have been at increased risk of these types of disasters because of poverty and social inequality, environmental degradation from poor land use and rapid population growth. Slow-onset disasters can be prevented because they happen over a long period of time and human decisions contribute to (or cause) problems. Early warning systems can be easily put in place to lessen or even prevent the disaster.\n\n3. Industrial/technological disasters result from a society\'s industrial and technological activities that lead to pollution, spillage, explosions, and fires. They may occur because of poor planning and construction of manmade facilities (buildings, factories, etc.) or from neglect of safety procedures. Sudden-onset disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and terrorist acts may trigger secondary disasters such as fires or pollution. Industrial events have the potential to cause large-scale loss of life and infrastructural damage, especially in developing countries with unregulated industrialization, and inadequate safety standards and disaster response capacity. Wherever there is a man-made facility, there is the potential for an industrial or technological disaster to occur. Reducing the occurrence and effects of industrial disasters requires a multi-sectoral approach.\n\n4. Complex emergencies are usually man-made, with multiple contributing factors. They often follow wars between states, internal conflict, and, increasingly, terrorist acts. Massive population displacements may occur due to lack of food, insecurity, and increasing death rates. Poverty and risk of conflict go hand in hand. Civilians that are not part of the conflicts end up bearing the majority of casualties because they are often targets of both sides of the conflict.\n\n5. Epidemic diseases are those diseases that normally do not occur in stable communities but have the potential to spread under certain conditions. This can cause frequent and severe outbreaks. These diseases may be spread by contaminated water or food, person-to-person contact, or through animals or insect vectors. Examples of epidemic diseases that commonly threaten displaced populations include cholera, measles, dysentery, respiratory infections, malaria, and, increasingly, HIV. After a major disaster, the risk of epidemic diseases increases mainly as a result of overcrowding and unhygienic conditions\n\n1.4. Phases of Disasters:\n\nDisaster situations are dynamic, always changing and demanding a change in response. Disasters can be viewed as a series of phases on a time continuum. Even though the evolving situation may appear continuous, identifying and understanding these phases helps to describe related needs and to conceptualize appropriate disaster management activities. These phases are described below:\n\n1. Pre-emergency phase: the period before the disaster strikes may be used to assess how often a particular community is exposed to different risks (risk mapping) and how good is their preparedness. Protective actions can be undertaken based on the disaster warning and the available resources, e.g. identifying temporary shelters, stocking basic supplies, planning evacuation routes, monitoring trends, etc.\n\n2. Impact and flight phase: when a disaster strikes the hazard (fire, earthquake, floods, conflicts, etc) may trigger the displacement of large number of people from their homes. How long this phase lasts depends on the type of disaster, the number people affected and the distance they must travel to find sanctuary. Search and rescue and other assistances, e.g. providing transportation, shelter and basic supplies to affected people may be carried out to reduce the loss of lives.\n\n3. Acute phase: this phase begins immediately after the impact of the disaster and marked by intense, often reactive activities by many humanitarian agencies responding to media reports of very high death rate (may be 5-60 times the normal death rate). The priority is to keep the affected people alive. Security may be a major concern in complex emergency situations. Critical services such as providing food, water, sanitation, basic health care, protection from violence and harassment are to be quickly organized. This phase ends when crude death rate falls below 1/10,000 persons per day (the crude mortality rate for stable population in Africa is about 0.5/10,000 individual per day).\n\n4. Post emergency phase: the population movement usually slows down. This enables critical services to be properly established and maintained. During this phase the cause of displacement may be evolving. The displaced people wait for "something to happen" so that they can return home, integrate with the local community or relocate else where. As international support declines, the emphasis shifts to building local capacity of and promoting community participation. Tracing reproductive health care, mental health care and other services may be initiated, based on the epidemiological information. It is difficult to set time limits on the post-disaster time phases or to accurately define the limits of each, even for one specific type of disaster. For example, the emergency phase of a hurricane or a flood may be only a few days, or as long as a week. A drought and a resulting famine can last for months or even a year or more.\n\n5. Repatriation phase: after the emergency situation is over, displaced people are expected to return to their place of origin either on their own or with the help of relief agencies. Repatriation may be either forced or voluntary.\n\n6. Rehabilitation or reconstruction phase: once permanent solution is obtained, the focus shifts from relief to development. The aim is to help the affected community become self-reliant. The responsibility of providing assistance is handed over to the affected community, the local authorities, development agencies and other non-governmental organizations. Because humanitarian and development technicians have different approaches to providing assistance and the infrastructure for relief is inadequate for development, the programs are re-oriented and redesigned.\n\nExercise:\n\n1.

Why do trends of disasters increase over time?\n\nCHAPTER TWO FACTORS LEADING TO DISASTERS\n\nLearning objectives:\n\nAt the end of the chapter the students are expected to:\n\n• Describe causes and consequences of deforestation.\n\n• Mention predisposing factors for droughts.\n\n• Identify impacts of droughts.\n\n• Describe the need for climatic change adaptation with respect to disasters.\n\n• Describe impacts of floods and public health interventions to reduce health effects.\n\n• Mention major causes of air pollutions.\n\n• Describe causes and impacts of global warming.\n\n• Mention the causes, impacts and public intervention of fires and explosions.\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nThere are numerous factors that trigger the occurrence of disasters ranging from natural to man made predisposing factors. It is beyond the scope of this lecture note to discuss all. Hence this chapter deals with some prominent factors that lead to disasters. This chapter is organized in such away that it imparts readers the magnitudes, impacts and, where possible, the management (prevention and control) of these disaster causing factors.\n\n2.2. Deforestation\n\nDefinition: Deforestation is the removal or damage of vegetation in a forest to the extent that it no longer supports its natural flora and fauna. It is most frequently caused by humans taking care of their immediate needs, while not being aware of the long-term effects of their actions.\n\nMagnitude: The rapid rate of deforestation in the tropics is a key driving force in the yearly increase of flood disasters. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization and United Nations Environmental Program (FAO/UNEP) study in 1981, tropical forests are disappearing at the rate of 7.3 million hectares (18 million acres) per year:\n\n• 4.2 million hectares (10.4 million acres) a year in Latin America\n\n• 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) a year in Asia\n\n• 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) a year in Africa.\n\nImpacts\n\nThe greatest and most immediate danger of deforestation is that gradually diminishing forested areas contribute to or worsen other disasters. For example, by removing vegetation that retains water, deforestation can lead to flooding, drought and desertification. By removing vegetation that stabilizes the soil, desertification can lead to erosion, siltation and an increased chance of landslides during earthquakes.\n\nImpact on Agriculture and Ecology\n\nDeforestation\'s impact on food supply follows this chain of events:\n\n1. Deforestation 2. Erosion\n\n3. Collapse of hillsides\n\n4. Loss of topsoil and agricultural land.\n\n5. Reduced productivity which leads to food insecurity.\n\nImpact on Economy\n\nWhat are the economic consequences of uncontrolled deforestation and forest-product scarcity?\n\n• Rising dependence on imported forest products. Already most of the Third World countries are net importers of forest products, particularly paper.\n\n• Foreign exchange shortages and high prices can hold a nation\'s wood and paper consumption well below the levels at which basic needs are satisfied.\n\n• Acute scarcities of firewood and timber plague wide areas of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\n• Soaring firewood prices are also another inflation source. In parts of West Africa and Central America, urban families spend one-fourth of their income on wood or charcoal for cooking.\n\nDeforestation and timber scarcity have an especially harmful impact on housing in poor countries. Even if Third World governments were to make a serious effort to meet the housing problem, adequate wood supplies would not be available in many cases. For example, in the late 1970s, the Indian state of Gujarat conceived of an ambitious plan to construct huts for landless laborers. The plan was derailed by the lack of raw materials. The program called for 25 million wood poles, but only 400,000 of those became available each year; and only four million bamboo stalks were produced a year, although 765 million were needed.\n\nManagement\n\nBut essential as they are, forestry measures alone will not be enough to solve the deforestation problem. Many of the underlying sources of deforestation originate outside the scope of forestry per se. In order to halt the destructive spread of cultivation, national development patterns must provide the destroyers with alternative ways to feed themselves; in particular, crop yields and employment must be boosted on the lands best suited to farming. Sound forestry policies can contribute to these efforts, but broader decisions on investment priorities, land tenure, and the choice of technologies will be even more critical. Woodland depletion by firewood gatherers can be greatly mitigated by tree planting, but broader attention to rural energy needs, alternative energy sources, and national energy priorities is also necessary. Of course, human population growth underlies all the sources of deforestation. A vast amount of tree planting is essential over the coming decades, but its benefits will be undercut if the deeper roots of deforestation are not eradicated. Deforestation also unbalances the water supply by contributing to drought and flood.\n\n2.3. Drought and famine\n\nDrought is defined as a water shortage caused by deficiency of rainfall and differs from other natural hazards in three ways:\n\nDrought is lack or insufficiency of rain for an extended period that severely disturbs the hydrologic cycle in an area. Droughts involve water shortages, crop damage, stream flow reduction, and depletion of groundwater and soil moisture. They occur when evaporation and transpiration exceed precipitation for a considerable period. Drought is the most serious hazard to agriculture in nearly every part of the world. Efforts have been made to control it by seeding clouds to induce rainfall, but these experiments have had only limited success.\n\nA famine is a phenomenon in which a large percentage of the populations of a region or country are so undernourished and that death by starvation becomes increasingly common. In spite of the much greater technological and economic resources of the modern world, famine still strikes many parts of the world, mostly in the developing nations. Famine is associated with naturally-occurring crop failure and pestilence and artificially with war and genocide\n\n• Drought has long been recognized as one of the most insidious causes of human misery.\n\n• It has today the unfortunate distinction of being the natural disaster that annually claims most victims.\n\n• Its ability to cause widespread misery is actually increasing.\n\nWhile generally associated with semiarid climates, drought can occur in areas that normally enjoy adequate rainfall and moisture levels. In the broadest sense, any lack of water for the normal needs of agriculture, livestock, industry, or human population may be termed a drought. The cause may be lack of supply, contamination of supply, inadequate storage or conveyance facilities, or abnormal demand. Drought is usually accompanied by hot, dry winds and may be followed by damaging floods.\n\nGeographical Distribution\n\nDroughts occur in all of the world\'s continents. In recent decades, the most severe and devastating to human populations have been in Africa, perhaps giving the impression that droughts are principally an African problem. In fact, devastating droughts have occurred in virtually all of the major semiarid regions of the world as well as in many zones that are normally temperate climates with significant annual rainfalls.\n\nIn addition to the droughts in the African Sahel, there have recently been major droughts in northeast Brazil, Chile, Ethiopia, the Philippines, the Bolivian altiplano, and India. Near-drought conditions in the grain-producing regions of the United States and the Soviet Union have also occurred, affecting greatly the international food supply and demand.\n\nTrends in the occurrence of droughts indicate that they are becoming more frequent on the edges of desert lands and where agricultural, lumbering, and livestock grazing practices are changing.\n\nNatural Preconditions for Drought Disasters\n\nDrought differs from other natural disasters in its slowness of onset and its commonly lengthy duration. Before the rise of modern water-consuming cities, drought was an agricultural disaster. Now, with cities having expanded faster than water supplies can be made available, the specter of drought faces both the farmer and the urban dweller. Shifts in atmospheric circulation, which cause drought, may extend for time scales of a month, a season, several years or even a century. The following are conditions that lead to drought:\n\n• Widespread and persistent atmospheric calm areas known as subsidence, which do not cause precipitation. These areas result from the present-day atmospheric circulation, which tends to create subsidence in the subtropical latitudes of both hemispheres.\n\n• Localized subsidence induced by mountain barriers or other physiographic features. Most such areas lie in the lee of mountains across the westerly belts. They are hence in midlatitudes. The dryness is caused by the warming of westerly currents as they descend east of the summits. This allows them to hold moisture and carry it away.\n\n• Absence of rainmaking disturbances causes dry weather even in areas of moist air. In general, rain is caused by the travel of organized disturbances across a region--i.e., systems that involve actual uplift of humid air. There is plenty of water in the air, but nothing to bring it down as rain.\n\n• Absence of humid airstreams. The relationship between the water available for precipitation (precipitable water) and the precipitation that actually falls is by no means simple.\n\nThe above four predisposing factors are interdependent, but their relative effect depends on season and locality. One can broadly distinguish between:\n\n1. Almost continuously dry climates, leading to desert surface conditions, in which there is no season of appreciable rainfall;\n\n2. Semiarid or sub-humid climates with a short wet season in which humid airstreams or rainmaking disturbances penetrate;\n\n3. The rare sub-humid areas in which rainfall is infrequent but not confined to a special season.\n\nHuman activities also contribute to the development of drought conditions. Overgrazing, poor cropping methods and improper soil conservation techniques often contribute to creating drought.\n\nRecurrence Interval\n\nClimatologists debate whether drought is a short-term aberration in the climate or the result of long-term climatic changes. Some argue that drought feeds upon itself; that as vegetation is stripped from the land; the surface dries out and reflects more of the sun\'s heat. This would alter the thermal dynamics of the atmosphere and suppress rainfall, which would, in turn, dry out more land.\n\nHistorically, droughts have tended to occur at regular intervals. Whether precisely predictable or not, the historical trends can give an indication as to when drought periods might be expected. For this reason, it is important that persons living in marginal or semiarid areas try to learn about the history of drought in that particular region and use this knowledge as a rule of thumb in predicting future drought periods.\n\nImpact of Droughts on Built and Natural Environments\n\nPrimary (Immediate) Effects\n\n• Water supplies are overtaxed and finally dry up\n\n• Loss of crops\n\n• Loss of livestock and other animals, and\n\n• Loss of water for hygienic use and drinking.\n\nSecondary (Resulting) Effects of Drought\n\n• Migration in search of better grazing lands\n\n• Famine\n\n• Permanent changes of settlement, social, and living patterns.\n\n• Major ecological changes (scrub growth, flash flooding and increased wind erosion of soils)\n\n• Desertification.\n\nThe Impact of Droughts on Development\n\nIf a drought is allowed to continue without response, the impact on development can be severe. Food shortages may become chronic. The country urban growth may be accelerated due to migration of people from rural areas. To respond to this, the government must borrow heavily and must divert money from other development schemes in order to meet these needs. All serve to undermine the potential for economic development.\n\nIf drought response is treated as only a relief operation, it may wipe out years of development work, especially in rural areas.\n\nAgricultural projects in particular are most likely to be affected by droughts. A balanced agricultural program that develops good water resources, addresses the problems of soil erosion, adopts realistic limits on the expansion of animal herds, or accompanies herd expansion with comprehensive range management will contribute to the mitigation of drought impact.\n\nThe same philosophy is used for reconstruction in the aftermath of a drought. Reconstruction should be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate development work. It is an ideal time to introduce improved animal husbandry techniques, rangeland management, water resource development schemes and erosion control measures.\n\nRelief Operations for Famine and Food Emergencies\n\nThe primary purpose of relief operations during famine is to provide food to inhibit the occurrence of malnutrition. The nutrition component of relief operations in times of famine and food emergency may be divided into two broad groups of interrelated activities dealing with general food rations and selective feeding programs. Often the provision of food assistance to disaster victims is accompanied by public health programs, particularly immunization campaigns and primary health care services.\n\nGeneral food rations: involves the complex interaction of nutritional planning, agency appeal and procurement, donor pledging, international shipping, national logistics, warehousing, inventory and distribution.\n\nSelective feeding programs: The purposes of selective feeding programs are to provide complete protection to population groups with increased vulnerability to nutritional deficiencies and to recuperate those already suffering from malnutrition. Selective feeding programs for disaster victims are usually divided into two distinct operations. Supplementary feeding programs are designed to protect vulnerable groups against malnutrition and to rehabilitate those individuals currently suffering from moderate protein-energy malnutrition (PEM).\n\nIntensive feeding programs (also called therapeutic feeding) are curative operations designed to reduce mortality among cases of severe PEM.\n\nFigure 5 African Countries facing food emergency, 1996 Map\n\nPublic health interventions\n\n• Monitor health and nutritional status by assessing using anthropometric measurements;\n\n• Monitor death rate;\n\n• Ensure safe water, sanitation, and disease control.\n\n• Assess and ensure food safety and security, including availability, accessibility, and consumption pattern;\n\n2.4. Epidemic\n\nDefinition:\n\nAn epidemic is the occurrence of a number of cases of a disease in excess of the usual occurrence for a given place and time.\n\nA threatened (or potential) epidemic is said to exist when the circumstances are such that the epidemic occurrence of a specific disease may reasonably be anticipated.\n\nThe spread of infectious disease depends upon preexisting levels of the disease, ecological changes resulting from disaster, population displacement, and changes in the density of population, disruption of public utilities, interruption of basic public health services, compromising the sanitation and hygiene. The probability that epidemics of infectious diseases will occur is proportional to the population density and displacement. An epidemic can occur in susceptible populations in the presence or impeding introduction of a disease agent compounded by the presence of a mechanism that facilitates large-scale transmission (For example, Contamination of water supply or increment of vector population).\n\nIn general, many natural and/or man made disasters that affect or disrupt one or more parts of the public health infrastructure, including the sanitation systems, potable water supplies, nutrition stores, primary health care access (including routine immunization program), vector control programs, and established systematic surveillance mechanisms, can trigger infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nImpact:\n\nDisplaced populations suffer high rate of disease due to stress of migration, crowding, and unsanitary conditions of relocation sites. Morbidity and mortality can result from diarrheal diseases, respiratory diseases, and malnutrition. Mortality exceeding a baseline of one death per 10,000 people per day is the index of concern.\n\nThe public health importance of an epidemic disease results from the number of persons at risk, risk of fatal cases or sequelae, speed of spread, disruption of social life and economic losses, possible contamination of water supply, food chains, local animal reservoirs and vectors, the risk of new epidemic situation and difficulty and cost associated with prevention and control.\n\nQuick response is essential because epidemics, which result in human and economic losses and political difficulties, often rise rapidly. An epidemic or threatened epidemic can become an emergency when the following characteristics of the events are present. Not all of the characteristics need to be present and each must be assessed with regard to relative importance equally:\n\n• Risk of introduction to and spread of the disease in the population;\n\n• Large number of cases may reasonably be expected to occur ;\n\n• Disease involved is of such severity as to lead to serious disability or death;\n\n• Risk of social or economic disruption resulting from the presence of the disease;\n\n• Authorities are unable to cope adequately with the situation due to insufficient technical or professional, organizational experiences, and necessary supplies or equipment (eg. Drugs, vaccines, laboratory diagnostic materials, vector control materials, etc.);\n\n• Risk of international transmission.\n\nPublic health intervention:\n\nSuccessful intervention requires rapid assessment to determine whether the breakdown points of infrastructure have occurred. Disaster managers, public health specialists, and health care providers should pay specific attention to the degree to which infection control measures have been affected during the acute disaster phase and should repair those defects and treat the cases that have been known.\n\n2.5. Pest Infestation\n\nPest infestation can cause tremendous damage to crop production and thus undermine the food security of a particular area. Locust\n\n(desert and migratory) and grasshopper\'s infestations are the main threats in sub-Saharan Africa. Current pest monitoring and control programs together with the promotion of agricultural diversity have lessened, though by no means eradicated, the threats of food shortages due to infestation.\n\nThe spread of emergent diseases and invasive species has increased dramatically in recent years. At the same time, numerous developments - such as the rapidly increasing trans-boundary movements of goods and people, trade liberalization, increasing concerns about food safety and the environment - have heightened the need for international cooperation in controlling and managing trans-boundary pests and diseases.\n\nCertain basic conditions affect the likelihood of trans-boundary pests and diseases establishing and spreading in regions or countries. These include: climate; geographical isolation; crops and livestock produced; production systems used; hosts and vectors widespread in or native to the country; and control methods used as part of routine agricultural management.\n\nRecent food safety issues related to diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and avian flu have become a serious concern for consumers, farmers, food processors, food retailers and governments alike. Furthermore, food contamination with non-authorized food additives, chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and acryl amide, microbiological pathogens (Salmonella, E. coli,) and mycotoxins, among others, have created worldwide concern regarding the safety of food supplies. To better address the existing and emerging challenges, FAO is recommending, as well as applying, a comprehensive approach, food chain approach, to food safety and quality issues that shares the responsibility for providing safe food among all players in the food and agricultural sector, from food producers and processors to retailers and consumer households.\n\nManagement/ Public health intervention:\n\nFAO recommends complementing regulation and control of end products, currently the main focus of many food safety programs, with preventive measures to control the introduction of hazards. This requires the adoption of good practices - in primary production, postharvest, processing and handling - that reduce the risk of microbiological and chemical contamination. In-plant controls of food processing operations should be based on:\n\n• Good Hygienic Practices (GHP),\n\n• Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and • The Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which identifies and then monitors the most vulnerable points in a food production system.\n\n2.6. Floods\n\nMagnitude: Global statistics show that floods are the most frequently recorded destructive events, accounting for about 30% of the world\'s disasters each year. The frequency of floods is increasing faster than any type of disaster. Much of this rise in incidence can be attributed to uncontrolled urbanization, deforestation, and more recently, the effect of El Niño. Floods may also accompany other natural disasters, such as sea surges during hurricanes and tsunamis following earthquake.\n\nImpact\n\nFlood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple communities. Except for flash floods, flooding causes few deaths. Widespread and long-lasting detrimental effects include mass homelessness, disruption of communications and health care systems, and heavy loss of business, livestock, crops, and grain, particularly in densely populated, low lying areas like that of the Awash Valley. The frequent repetition of flooding means a constant or even increasing drain on the economy for rural as well as urban populations.\n\nAcute effect: The early health effects of floods include death through drowning and accidents such as falls, electrocution and the effect of landslides. People lose their homes and often also lose their source of food and water. If the drinking water supply and sanitation system is already inadequate, flooding poses a further major health threat. Sanitation is a major problem in all flooded areas, as demonstrated by recent floods in Mexico, Ghana Mozambique and in Ethiopia. Industrial waste, such as engine oil and refuse dumps, adds to the health risks of floods.\n\nThe severe flooding in China in 1998 killed more than 5,500 people and left at least 21 million homeless (Kriner, 1999).\n\nLong term effect: In addition to the acute effects, the floodwaters provide an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and an increased risk of diseases such as dengue, malaria and Rift Valley Fever. They also displace rodent populations, which may cause human outbreaks of leptospirosis and Hantavirus infection. The combined effects of open sewage and reduced opportunities for good personal hygiene also favor the spread of infections causing diarrhea, such as cholera and gastrointestinal viruses. Flooding in the horn of Africa in 1997, associated with ENSO, and caused an upsurge in cholera deaths due to the lethal combination of damage to sanitation and contamination of water supplies (WHO, 1998). During flooding in Bolivia and Peru in the mid 1980s, increases in diarrheal diseases and acute respiratory diseases were recorded (WHO, 1999). Prolonged heavy rainfall causes fewer deaths than floods, but the infection risk is just as high in areas of poor sanitation.\n\nFlooding affects health indirectly through the widespread damage to the infrastructure of a community: its roads, buildings, equipment, drainage, sewerage and water supply systems. For example, during flooding in Peru in 1997/98, nearly a tenth of the health facilities were damaged: in Ecuador during the same period 2% of the hospitals were put out of action by a combination of flooding, mud, damage to sewerage systems and contamination of the drinking water supply. The mental distress of flooding may persist long after the floods have receded, since people have lost their homes, their livelihood and their confidence.\n\nRisk of morbidity and mortality\n\nFlood related mortality varies from country to country. Flash flooding such as from excessive rainfall or sudden release of water from a dam, is the cause of most flood-related deaths. Most flood-related death victims become trapped in their car and drown when attempting to drive through (or attempting to cross in the case of rural settings) rising of swiftly moving water. Other deaths have been caused by wading, bicycling, or other recreational activities in flooded areas.\n\nLife-threatening characteristics of floods:\n\n• Absence of warning of a flood (either \'official\' warning or warning derived from cues e.g. heavy rain).\n\n• High floodwater velocities (like in hilly or mountainous terrain or where stream disgorge on to plains from upland areas; in river valleys with steep gradients; in areas behind floods embankments or natural barriers which may breach or overtop, below dams which may break).\n\n• Rapid speed of flood onset (like in areas when streams are \'flashy\' i.e. rise and fall rapidly; these are usually urban areas or arid rural areas where soil surface becomes compacted and hard; or in areas where high floodwater velocities are expected).\n\n• Deep floodwater: where floodwater is in excess of one meter depth (occurs in or close to river channels; in depression which may not be easy to identify by eye; behind overtopped flood embankments and in basements of buildings).\n\n• Long duration floods (like where land is flat, flooding is extensive; river gradients are very low, channels are obstructed, and flood water become trapped behind natural or artificial barriers).\n\n• Flood has more than one peak (not atypical on complex river systems where tributaries contribute to river flows, or where flooding is tidal).\n\n• Debris load of floodwaters (usually greatest in high velocity floods; floodwater may contain trees, building debris etc which may either provide floating refuge, or threaten life).\n\n• Characteristics of accompanying weather (especially windy, unusually cold or hot weather).\n\n• Flood may display combinations of characteristics!\n\nManagement/ Protective Measures\n\nBefore a Flood, you should:\n\n• Avoid building in a floodplain unless you elevate and reinforce your home.\n\n• Elevate the furnace, water heater, and electric panel if susceptible to flooding.\n\n• Install "check valves" in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains of your home.\n\n• Construct barriers (levees, beams, floodwalls) to stop floodwater from entering the building.\n\n• Seal walls in basements with waterproofing compounds to avoid seepage.\n\n• Learning swimming skill is helpful.\n\nDuring a Flood\n\nIf a flood is likely in your area, you should:\n\n• Listen to the radio or television for information.\n\n• Be aware that flash flooding can occur. If there is any possibility of a flash flood, move immediately to higher ground. Do not wait for instructions to move.\n\n• Be aware of streams, drainage channels, canyons, and other areas known to flood suddenly. Flash floods can occur in these areas with or without such typical warnings as rain clouds or heavy rain.\n\nIf you must prepare to evacuate, you should do the following:\n\n• Secure your home. If you have time, bring in outdoor furniture. Move essential items to an upper floor.\n\n• Turn off utilities at the main switches or valves if instructed to do so. Disconnect electrical appliances. Do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in water.\n\nIf you have to leave your home, remember these evacuation tips:\n\n• Do not walk through moving water. Six inches of moving water can make you fall. If you have to walk in water, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.\n\n• Do not drive into flooded areas. If flood-waters rise around your car, abandon the car and move to higher ground if you can do so safely.\n\nAfter a Flood:\n\nThe following are guidelines for the period following a flood:\n\n• Listen for news reports to learn whether the community\'s water supply is safe to drink.\n\n• Avoid floodwaters; water may be contaminated by oil, gasoline, or raw sewage. Water may also be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines.\n\n• Avoid moving water.\n\n• Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded. Roads may have weakened and could collapse under the weight of a car.\n\n• Stay away from downed power lines, and report them to the power authorities.\n\n• Return home only when authorities indicate it is safe.\n\n• Stay out of any building if it is surrounded by floodwaters.\n\n• Use extreme caution when entering buildings; there may be hidden damage, particularly in foundations.\n\n• Service damaged septic tanks, cesspools, pits, and leaching systems as soon as possible. Damaged sewage systems are serious health hazards.\n\n• Clean and disinfect everything that got wet. Mud left from floodwater can contain sewage and chemicals.\n\nPublic Health Interventions\n\n• Conduct needs assessment to determine the status of public health infrastructure, utilities (e.g. water, sewage, electricity), and health, medical, and pharmaceutical needs.\n\n• Conduct surveillance of drinking water sources, injuries, increases in vector populations, and endemic, water-borne and vector-borne diseases.\n\n• Organize delivery of health care services and supplies, and continuity of care.\n\n• Educate public regarding proper sanitation and hygiene.\n\n• Educate public regarding proper clean up.\n\n2.7. Tsunamis\n\nDefinition: A tsunami is a series of waves generated by an under sea disturbance such as an earthquake. From the area of the disturbance, the waves will travel outward in all directions, much like the ripples caused by throwing a rock into a pond. As the waves approach the shallow coastal waters, they appear normal and speed decreases. Then as the tsunami nears coastline, it may grow to a great height and smash into the shore, causing such destruction.\n\nTsunamis (pronounced soo-ná-mees), also known as seismic sea waves (mistakenly called "tidal waves"), are a series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more.\n\nProtective Measures\n\nGuidelines for what you should do if a tsunami is likely in your area:\n\n• Turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning\n\n• Move inland to higher ground immediately and stay there.\n\n• If there is noticeable recession in water away from the shoreline this is nature\'s tsunami warning and it should be heeded. You should move away immediately\n\nGuidelines for the period following a tsunami:\n\n• Stay away from flooded and damaged areas until officials say it is safe to return.\n\n• Stay away from debris in the water; it may pose a safety hazard to boats and people.\n\n2.8. Earthquakes\n\nDefinition: Earthquakes are sudden slippages or movements in a portion of the earth\'s crust accompanied by a series of vibrations. Aftershocks of similar or lesser intensity can follow the main quake.\n\nEarthquakes can occur at any time of the year. An earthquake is generally considered to be the most destructive and frightening of all forces of nature.\n\nMagnitude:\n\nThe Richter scale, used as an indication of the force of an earthquake, measures the magnitude and intensity or energy released by the quake. This value is calculated based on data recordings from a single observation point for events anywhere on earth, but it does not address the possible damaging effects of the earthquake. According to global observations, an average of two earthquakes of a Richter magnitude 8 or slightly more occur every year. A one digit drop in magnitude equates with a tenfold increase in frequency. Therefore, earthquakes of magnitude 7 or more generally occur 20 times in a year, while those with a magnitude 6 or more occur approximately 200 times.\n\nSpecific active seismic zones have been identified around the globe. Millions of people live in these seismic zones and are exposed to threat of an earthquake daily. The damage caused by an earthquake can be extensive especially to incompatible building types and construction techniques. Also, an earthquake usually ignite fires, which can spread rapidly among damaged buildings if the water system has been disabled and fire services cannot access the site of the fire.\n\nImpact\n\nEarthquake losses, like those of other disasters, tend to cause more financial losses in industrialized countries and, as the developed countries have better early warning systems and life saving means, more injuries and deaths occur in undeveloped countries. Deaths and injuries from earthquakes vary according to the type of housing available, time of day of occurrence, and population density. Common injuries include cuts, broken bones, crush injuries, and dehydration from being trapped in rubble. Stress reactions are also common. Morbidity and mortality can occur during the actual quake, the delayed collapse of unsound structures, or clean-up activity.\n\nPublic health intervention\n\nPublic health officials can intervene both in advance of and after earthquakes to prevent post-earthquake injuries. The safety of homes and the work environment can be improved by building standards that require stricter codes and use of safer materials. Measures to prevent injuries include securing appliances, securing hanging items on walls or overhead, turning off utilities, storing hazardous materials in safe, well-ventilated areas, and checking homes for hazards such as windows and glass that might shatter.\n\nProtective Measures\n\nBefore an Earthquake:\n\n• Repair defective electrical wiring, leaky gas cylinders, and inflexible utility connections.\n\n• Place large or heavy objects on lower shelves. Fasten shelves, mirrors, and large picture frames to walls.\n\n• Store bottled foods, glass, china clay, and other breakables on low shelves or in cabinets that fasten shut.\n\n• Anchor overhead lighting fixtures.\n\n• Be sure the residence is firmly anchored to its foundation.\n\nInstall flexible pipe fittings to avoid gas or water leaks. Flexible fittings are more\n\n• Resistant to breakage.\n\n• Locate safe spots in each room under a sturdy table or against an inside wall.\n\n• Hold earthquake drills with your family members: Drop, cover, and hold on!\n\nDuring an Earthquake: minimize your movements during an earthquake to a few steps to a nearby safe place. Stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe.\n\nI. If you are indoor:\n\n• Take cover under a sturdy desk, table, or bench or against an inside wall, and hold on. If there isn\'t a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.\n\n• Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, such as lighting fixtures or furniture.\n\n• Stay in bed - if you are there when the earthquake strikes-hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.\n\n• Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load bearing doorway.\n\n• Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Most injuries during earthquakes occur when people are hit by falling objects when entering into or exiting from buildings.\n\n• Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.\n\n• DO NOT use elevators.\n\nII. If you are Outdoors:\n\n• Move away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.\n\nIII. If you are In a moving vehicle:\n\n• Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.\n\n• Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped, watching for road and bridge damage.\n\nIV. If you are trapped under debris:\n\n• Do not light a match. Do not move about or kick up dust.\n\n• Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.\n\n• Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort-shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.\n\nAfter an Earthquake: be prepared for aftershocks. These secondary shockwaves are usually less violent than the main quake, but can be strong enough to do additional damage to weakened structures.\n\n• Open cabinets cautiously. Beware of objects that can fall off shelves.\n\n• Stay away from damaged areas unless your assistance has been specifically requested by police, fire, or relief organizations.\n\n• Be aware of possible tsunamis if you live in coastal areas.\n\nPublic health interventions:\n\n• Encourage earthquake drills to practice emergency procedures;\n\n• Recommend items for inclusion in an extensive first aid kit and survival kit for home and automobile, and encourage maintenance of those kits;\n\n• Teach basic precautions regarding safe water and safe food;\n\n• Ensure the provision of emergency medical care to those who seek immediate care in the first three to five days after an earthquake;\n\n• Ensure continuity of care for those who have lost access to prescriptions, home care, and other medical necessities;\n\n• Conduct surveillance for communicable disease and injuries, including location and severity of injury, disposition of patients, and follow up contact information;\n\n• Prepare media advisories with appropriate warning and advice for injury prevention;\n\n• Establish environmental control;\n\n• Facilitate use of surveillance forms by search and rescue teams to record types of buildings, addresses of site, type of collapse, amount of dust, fire or toxic hazards, location of victims, and nature and severity of injuries.\n\n2.9. Pollutions and health consequences of pollutions:\n\nDefinition:\n\nPollution: is undesirable state of the natural environment being contaminated with harmful substances as a consequence of human activities. Pollution is the contamination of the air, water, or earth by harmful or potentially harmful substances.\n\nOver the past 100 years, the state of the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments has declined in virtually all respects. Environmental degradation and resource depletion have escalated particularly over the past three decades due to the cumulative impacts of rapid growth in population, intensive agriculture, urbanization and industrialization. The priority list of environmental challenges includes land degradation, deforestation, declining biodiversity and marine resources, water scarcity, and deteriorating water and air quality.\n\nA major reason for these adverse environmental trends in Africa is that most people and countries are poor. Their poverty is both a cause and a consequence of environmental degradation. However, the main cause of many environmental problems is the persistence of economic, agricultural, energy, industrial and other sectoral policies which largely neglect - and fail to avoid - harmful impacts on the environment and natural resource base.\n\n2.9.1. Air pollution:\n\nAir pollution is the presence in the air of substances put there by the acts of man in concentrations sufficient to interfere with health, comfort, or safety, or with full use and enjoyment of property.\n\nThe term is often used to identify undesirable substances produced by human activity. Air pollution usually designates the collection of substances that adversely affect human health, animals, and plants; deteriorates structures; interferes with commerce; or interferes with the enjoyment of life.\n\nPrimary Pollutants & their Health Effects:\n\nParticulate Matter (PM):\n\nParticulate matter consists of soot and dust particles that are smaller than the diameter of a human hair. Particulate matter is all particles smaller than 10 microns in diameter are classified as PM10 or coarse size particles. Fine size particles, or PM2.5, are those particles less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter. Sources of PM include diesel exhaust, soil dust, tire wear, and soot. These particles penetrate deeply into the lungs and are captured by lung tissue. A major contributor to the PM pollution problem is exhaust from diesel vehicles, which produce 79% of the particulate emissions from mobile sources. Exposure to PM pollution has been associated with respiratory and cardiac problems, infections, asthma attacks, lung cancer and decreased life expectancy. The World Health Organization has estimated that 500,000 premature deaths each year may be associated with PM pollution. The American Lung Association believes that PM2.5 represents the most serious threat to our health. Segments of the population that are more susceptible to PM pollution include children, athletes, senior citizens, and people with pre-existing respiratory problems.\n\nOzone (O3)\n\nOzone forms when hydrocarbons combine with nitrogen oxides and chemically react in sunlight. Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are primarily produced by motor vehicles and various industrial practices. Ozone is a highly reactive oxidizing agent that breaks-down organic materials. Ozone is the primary component of smog. A natural phenomenon called an "inversion layer" traps these gases and prevents them from dissipating into the atmosphere. Symptoms of ozone exposure are coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, fatigue, throat dryness, chest pain, headache and nausea. Ozone has been shown to cause inflammation of lung tissue and reduced lung capacity. Development of asthma, increased lung cancer mortality rates, and accelerated lung aging has all been linked to ozone exposure. Lung damage from long-term exposure to ozone can be permanent, while short-term exposure appears to be reversible. Ozone reduces the respiratory system\'s ability to fight infection and remove foreign particles such as particulate matter. Segments of the population that are more susceptible to ozone pollution include children, athletes, senior citizens, and people with pre-existing respiratory problems.\n\nHydrocarbons\n\nHydrocarbons are a class of reactive organic gases (ROG), which are formed solely of hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of ozone and the resulting smog problem. Carcinogenic forms of hydrocarbons are considered hazardous air pollutants, or air toxics. The incomplete burning of any organic matter such as oil, wood, or rubber produces hydrocarbons. Combustion engine exhaust, oil refineries, and oil-fueled power plants are the primary sources of hydrocarbons. Another source of hydrocarbons is evaporation from petroleum fuels, solvents, dry cleaning solutions, and paint. The primary health effect of hydrocarbons results from the formation of ozone and its related health effects. High levels of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere can interfere with oxygen intake by reducing the amount of available oxygen through displacement.\n\nNitrogen Oxides (NOx): Nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)\n\n• The two forms of nitrogen oxide found in the atmosphere.\n\n• Contribute to the formation of ozone, production of particulate matter pollution, and acid deposition.\n\n• Produced by factories, motor vehicles and power plants that burn fossil fuels\n\n• NO2 irritates lung tissue, causes bronchitis and pneumonia, and reduces resistance to respiratory infections\n\n• Frequent or long-term exposure to high levels of nitrogen oxides can increase the incidence of acute respiratory illness in children.\n\nCarbon Monoxide (CO)\n\n• CO is colorless, odorless gas produced by burning organic matter such as oil, natural gas, fuel, wood, and charcoal.\n\n• Displaces oxygen in red blood cells, which reduces the amount of oxygen that human cells need for respiration.\n\n• Exposure to CO can result in fatigue, angina, reduced visual perception, reduced dexterity, and death.\n\n• The elderly, young children, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions are particularly sensitive\n\n• Extremely deadly in an enclosed space, such as a garage or bedroom.\n\nSulfur Dioxide (SO2)\n\n• A colorless gas produced by motor vehicles, refineries, and power plants that burn fossil fuels.\n\n• Reduces respiratory volume, and increases breathing resistance in those exposed, especially asthmatics.\n\n• Increases nasal airway resistance.\n\n2.9.2. Water pollution and contamination\n\nWater is necessary for industries which are therefore often located near a river. Thus, natural disasters may not only affect the water resources and their management directly but floods and earthquakes may also destroy industries producing or using toxic materials or dangerous chemicals which might be released into floodwaters.\n\nThese harmful materials include organic wastes, sediments, minerals, nutrients, thermal pollutants, toxic chemicals, and other hazardous substances. Organic wastes are produced by animals and humans, and include such things as fecal matter, crop debris, yard clippings, food wastes, and rubber, plastic, wood, and disposable diapers.\n\nTheir origin is human industrial activity and they can be avoided through properly applied policies and good decision making. With increased urbanization, increase in population density and industrialization, the problem of pollution might also become more important. The polluted water may cause death or diseases by poisoning.\n\nWorldwide, a considerable number of diseases are linked to the interrelated problems of water quality, water availability, sanitation and hygiene.\n\nNatural networks of rivers, lakes and marshes, also play a role in the transmission of water-related and vector-borne diseases. If these undergo increased flooding, community water supplies could become contaminated, leading to greater incidence of faecal-oral diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and diarrhea.\n\nDeveloping countries are at most risk with respect to waterborne and Water-washed diseases and urban communities are at greater risk than rural communities.\n\nAny increase in heavy precipitation and consequently in runoff from agricultural lands, would also be likely to increase contamination of water with chemicals such as pesticides.\n\n2.10. Global warming\n\nHow might the climate change?\n\nThe earth\'s climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The heat-trapping property of these gases is undisputed. Although uncertainty exists about exactly how earth\'s climate responds to these gases, global temperatures are rising.\n\nScientists use computer-based models to predict the effects on global climate of different levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. According to the most recent projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global mean temperature could increase by 1.4°C to 5.8°C between 1990 and 2100.\n\nThe climatic effects of such a temperature increase might include:\n\n• More frequent extreme high maximum temperatures and less frequent extreme low minimum temperatures;\n\n• An increase in the variability of climate, with changes to both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events;\n\n• Alterations to the natural biological range of certain infectious diseases;\n\n• Rising sea levels.\n\nEffects of global warming\n\nGlobal warming can be expected to produce changes in the frequency of intense rainfall. Higher sea-surface temperatures can be expected to increase the intensity of tropical cyclones and to expand the area over which they may develop. Rainfall intensity is likely to increase with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations and there may be an increasing concentration of rainfall on fewer rain days.\n\nAs climatic warming occurs, there will be notable changes in the hydrology of Arctic areas. River-ice regime might be altered and substantial effects on the hydrology can be expected that will affect flow, water levels, and storage. It is reasonable to think that an increase in the frequency and intensity of floods may be associated with an increase in the occurrence and severity of droughts in order to compensate the first extreme and to reestablish the natural energy and water balance.\n\nExposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation as the result of global warming\n\nOverexposure to UV radiation in sunlight can result in painful sunburn. It can also lead to more serious health effects, including skin cancer, premature aging of the skin, and other skin disorders; cataracts and other eye damage; and immune system suppression.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious impact of global warming will be the direct effects: a warmer planet will experience more extreme heat waves. As seen in Europe, the scorching weather may have claimed as many as 35,000 lives in 2003; heat waves often lead to an increase in the number of human deaths.\n\nTechnological adaptations such as the installation of effective air-conditioners and the construction of heat-minimizing houses will happen more quickly among the rich, so heat waves are likely to have a disproportionate effect in less-developed countries and in the poorer segments of rich societies.\n\nRising sea levels as the result of global warming\n\nGlobal warming is predicted to lead to thermal expansion of sea water. Scientists predict that sea levels will rise as the global temperature rises, due to the melting of land-based ice in the Polar Regions and glaciers, and the thermal expansion of the oceans. According to the most recent projections, sea levels could rise between 9 and 88 centimeters by the year 2100. A rise of this magnitude would have disastrous consequences for people living on low-lying islands, such as the Maldives group in the Indian Ocean and many South Pacific islands. In parts of Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, China, the Netherlands, Florida, and other low-lying coastal areas already suffering from poor drainage, agriculture is likely to become increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nHigher sea levels lead to coastal flooding and an increase in the frequency of extreme high water levels from storm surges. Related problems are the contamination of coastal freshwater supplies with encroaching sea water, and the degradation of fishing and agricultural areas.\n\nInfectious diseases as the result of global warming:\n\nMany infectious diseases are dependent on vector organisms, which are sensitive to environmental factors and therefore will be affected by global warming. Biological modeling under various climate scenarios suggests a widening of the potential transmission zone of some disease-causing pathogens and their vectors, such as mosquitoes.\n\nScientists speculate that if temperatures rise under global warming, the incidence of diseases caused by food-poisoning and by the contamination of drinking (and swimming) water could increase dramatically.\n\nExtreme events and disasters as the result of global warming:\n\nMost computer models generated by scientists indicate that the future climate will be more variable than the past and those droughts and floods will be more severe. Some of the health effects of weather-related disasters, in addition to the immediate death and injury to people and damage to property, include:\n\n• Increases in psychological stress, depression, and feelings of isolation amongst people affected by natural disasters;\n\n• Decreases in nutrition due to poorer agricultural yields caused, for example, by prolonged drought and problems of food distribution;\n\n• Increases in disease transmission due to a breakdown in sewerage and garbage services.\n\nEffects of Climate Variations and Climate Change\n\nClimate variations is a term referring to year to year or inter-annual fluctuations in the annual cycle, including also anomalous cycles ranging from two to ten years in duration.\n\nClimate variability persistent over a ten years period is referred to as climate change. Scientists are now increasingly able to link extreme weather events such as droughts and storms with climate variations and climate change. The Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 1995) concluded that: there is evidence, from climate models and hydrological impact studies, which flood frequencies, are likely to increase with global warming.\n\nClimate change may increase the risk of death, according to World Health Organization report of 2006. Many important diseases that affect developing countries are sensitive to climate variations, according to the report, and even a proportionally small change in the global incidence of some diseases could result in significant public health impacts far into the future. The authors of Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses quantified the relative risk of death in 2030 from diarrhea, malaria, and cardiovascular disease related to heat and cold, malnutrition, and flooding in several developed and developing regions (22).\n\n"Provision of clean water and sanitation not only cuts overall diarrhea rates, but also decreases the importance of the bacterial pathogens that respond positively to temperature, and decreases risks of diarrhea outbreaks following floods."\n\nEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\n\nOne of the most spectacular climate variation consequences is El-Niño.\n\nThe El Niño event, a warm water current along the coast of Peru and Chile, is part of a climatic phenomenon known as the El-Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which strongly affects tropical and midlatitude countries. Impacts of ENSO are droughts over Southeast Asia, northeastern Brazil and southern Africa, heavy rains in the tropical Pacific and the west coast of the Americas at tropical and mid-latitudes. The generation of ENSO is not yet fully understood. Its recurrence interval varies from two to seven years, with an average of four years.\n\nSource: http://www.who.int/globalchange/en/ (date of access Aug 10, 2006)\n\nFigure 6: Effects of climate change on the ecosystem\n\n2.11. Ozone depletion:\n\nThe Connection between Ozone Depletion and UVB Radiation: Reductions in ozone levels will not result in the sun\'s output of UVB change; rather, less ozone means less protection, and will lead to higher levels of UVB reaching the Earth\'s surface hence more UVB reaches the Earth. Studies have shown that in the Antarctic, the amount of UVB measured at the surface can double during the annual ozone hole. Another study confirmed the relationship between reduced ozone and increased UVB levels in Canada during the past several years.\n\nUVB is a kind of ultraviolet light from the sun (and sun lamps) that has adverse effects on lives. Particularly it is effective at damaging DNA. It is a cause of melanoma and other types of skin cancer. It has also been linked to damage to some materials, crops, and marine organisms. The ozone layer protects the Earth against most UVB coming from the sun. It is always important to protect oneself against UVB, even in the absence of ozone depletion, by wearing hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen.\n\nCauses of Ozone Depletion\n\nOzone depletion occurs when the natural balance between the production and destruction of stratospheric ozone is tipped in favour of destruction. Although natural phenomena can cause temporary ozone loss, chlorine and bromine released from man-made compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are now accepted as the main cause of this depletion.\n\nIt was first suggested by Drs. M. Molina and S. Rowland in 1974 that a man-made group of compounds known as the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were likely to be the main source of ozone depletion. However, this idea was not seriously taken until the discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in 1985 by the British Antarctic Survey.\n\nChlorofluorocarbons are not "washed" back to Earth by rain or destroyed in reactions with other chemicals. They simply do not break down in the lower atmosphere and they can remain in the atmosphere from 20 to 120 years or more. As a consequence of their relative stability, CFCs are instead transported into the stratosphere where they are eventually broken down by ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun, releasing free chlorine. The chlorine becomes actively involved in the process of destruction of ozone. The net result is that two molecules of ozone are replaced by three of molecular oxygen, leaving the chlorine free to repeat the process:\n\nCl + O3 ClO + O2\n\nClO + O Cl + O2\n\nOzone is converted to oxygen, leaving the chlorine atom free to repeat the process up to 100,000 times, resulting in a reduced level of ozone. Bromine compounds, or halons, can also destroy stratospheric ozone. Compounds containing chlorine and bromine from man-made compounds are known as industrial halocarbons. Emissions of CFCs have accounted for roughly 80% of total stratospheric ozone depletion.\n\nThe problem of ozone depletion is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere. The origins of these compounds are chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), used as cooling substances in air-conditioners and refrigerators, or as aerosol propellants, and bromofluorocarbons (halons), used in fire extinguishers. As a result of depletion of the ozone layer more UV radiation comes to Earth and causes damage to living organisms. UV radiation seems responsible for skin cancer in humans; it lowers production of phytoplankton, and thus affects other aquatic organisms. It can also influence the growth of terrestrial plants.\n\nThe Effects of Ozone Depletion\n\nOn Human Health\n\nLaboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UVB causes nonmelanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. In addition, UVB has been linked to cataracts. All sunlight contains some UVB, even with normal ozone levels. It is always important to limit exposure to the sun. However, ozone depletion will increase the amount of UVB and the risk of health effects.\n\nOn Plants\n\nPhysiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by UVB radiation, even by the amount of UVB in present-day sunlight. Despite mechanisms to reduce or repair these effects and a limited ability to adapt to increased levels of UVB, plant growth can be directly affected by UVB radiation.\n\nIndirect changes caused by UVB (such as changes in plant form, how nutrients are distributed within the plant, timing of developmental phases and secondary metabolism) may be equally, or sometimes more, important than damaging effects of UVB. These changes can have important implications for plant competitive balance, herbivory, plant diseases, and biogeochemical cycles.\n\nOn Marine Ecosystems\n\nPhytoplankton forms the foundation of aquatic food webs. Phytoplankton productivity is limited to the euphotic zone, the upper layer of the water column in which there is sufficient sunlight to support net productivity. The position of the organisms in the euphotic zone is influenced by the action of wind and waves. In addition, many phytoplanktons are capable of active movements that enhance their productivity and, therefore, their survival. Exposure to solar UVB radiation has been shown to affect both orientation mechanisms and motility in phytoplankton, resulting in reduced survival rates for these organisms. Scientists have demonstrated a direct reduction in phytoplankton production due to ozone depletion-related increases in UVB. One study has indicated a 6-12% reduction in the marginal ice zone (43).\n\nSolar UVB radiation has been found to cause damage to early developmental stages of fish, shrimp, crab, amphibians and other animals. The most severe effects are decreased reproductive capacity and impaired larval development. Even at current levels, solar UVB radiation is a limiting factor, and small increases in UVB exposure could result in significant reduction in the size of the population of animals that eat these smaller creatures.\n\nOn Biogeochemical Cycles\n\nIncreases in solar UV radiation could affect terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemical cycles, thus altering both sources and sinks of greenhouse and chemically-important trace gases e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbonyl sulfide (COS) and possibly other gases, including ozone. These potential changes would contribute to biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks that attenuate or reinforce the atmospheric buildup of these gases.\n\nUVB: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths from 280-320 nanometers produced by the Sun\n\nUVC: a band of ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths shorter than 280 nanometers\n\n2.12. Tornado\n\nTornados are rapidly whirling, funnel-shaped air spirals that emerge from a violent thunderstorm and reach the ground. Tornados can have a wind velocity of up to 200 miles per hour and generate sufficient force to destroy even massive buildings. The extent of damage depends on updrafts within the tornado funnel, the tornado\'s atmospheric pressure (which is often lower than the surrounding barometric pressure), and the effects of flying debris.\n\nRisk of Morbidity and Mortality\n\nInjuries from tornados occur due to flying debris or people being thrown by the high winds (i.e., head injuries, soft tissue injury, and secondary wound infection). Stress-related disorders are more common, as is disease related to loss of utilities, potable water, or shelter.\n\nInjury Prevention\n\nIn the event of a tornado, the residents should take shelter in a basement if possible, away from windows, while protecting their heads. People with special needs should have a "buddy" who has a copy of the list and who knows of the emergency box.\n\nPublic Health Interventions\n\n• Work with emergency management on tornado shelter drills for vulnerable communities.\n\n• Conduct needs assessment using maps that detail preexisting neighborhoods, including landmarks, and aerial reconnaissance.\n\n• Ensure the provision of medical care, shelter, food, and water.\n\n• Establish environmental controls.\n\n• Establish a surveillance system based at both clinical sites and shelters.\n\n2.13. Fires\n\nThere are two types of fire disasters. They are domestic and wild fires. Fires can be triggered or exacerbated by lightning, high winds, earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and deliberate setting of fire by human beings. Lightning is the most significant natural contributor to fires affecting the building environment. Buildings with rooftop storage tanks for flammable liquids are particularly susceptible.\n\nTo protect yourself, it is important to understand the basic characteristics of fire. Fire spreads quickly; there is no time to gather valuables or make a phone call. In just two minutes, a fire can become life-threatening. In five minutes, a residence can be engulfed in flames. Heat and smoke from fire can be more dangerous than the flames. Inhaling the super-hot air can sear your lungs. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you disoriented and drowsy. Instead of being awakened by a fire, you may fall into a deeper sleep. Asphyxiation is the leading cause of fire deaths, exceeding burns by a three-to-one ratio.\n\nManagement\n\nBefore a Fire (mostly for developed countries)\n\nSmoke Alarms\n\n• Install smoke alarms. Properly working smoke alarms decrease your chances of dying in a fire by half.\n\n• Place smoke alarms on every level of your residence. Place them outside bedrooms on the ceiling or high on the wall (4 to 12 inches from ceiling), at the top of open stairways, or at the bottom of enclosed stairs and near (but not in) the kitchen.\n\n• Test and clean smoke alarms once a month and replace batteries at least once a year. Replace smoke alarms once every 10 years.\n\n• Have record of fire brigades telephone in safe and accessible to member of the family.\n\n• Making aware the people about care (prevention), escape mechanisms.\n\nEscaping the Fire\n\n• Review escape routes with your family. Practice escaping from each room.\n\n• Make sure windows are not nailed or painted shut. Make sure security gratings on windows have a fire safety opening feature so they can be easily opened from the inside.\n\n• Consider escape ladders if your residence has more than one level, and ensure that burglar bars and other antitheft mechanisms that block outside window entry are easily opened from the inside.\n\n• Teach family members to stay low to the floor (where the air is safer in a fire) when escaping from a fire.\n\n• Clean out storage areas. Do not let trash, such as old newspapers, magazines, other materials and equipments accumulation.\n\nWith regards to Flammable Items\n\n• Never use gasoline, benzene, naphtha, or similar flammable liquids indoors.\n\n• Store flammable liquids in approved containers in well-ventilated storage areas.\n\n• Never smoke near flammable liquids.\n\n• Discard all rags or materials that have been soaked in flammable liquids after you have used them. Safely discard them outdoors in a metal container.\n\n• Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top. The chimney should be at least three feet higher than the roof. Remove branches hanging above and around the chimney.\n\nWith regards to Heating Sources\n\n• Be careful when using alternative heating sources.\n\n• Place heaters at least three feet away from flammable materials. Make sure the floor and nearby walls are properly insulated.\n\n• Use only the type of fuel designated for your unit and follow manufacturer\'s instructions.\n\n• Store ashes in a metal container outside and away from your residence.\n\n• Keep open flames away from walls, furniture, drapery, and flammable items.\n\n• Keep a screen in front of the fireplace.\n\n• Have heating units inspected and cleaned annually by a certified specialist.\n\nWith regards to Matches and Smoking\n\n• Keep matches and lighters up high, away from children, and, if possible, in a locked cabinet.\n\n• Never smoke in bed or when drowsy or medicated. Provide smokers with deep, sturdy ashtrays. Douse cigarette and cigar butts with water before disposal.\n\nWith regards to Electrical Wiring\n\n• Have the electrical wiring in your residence checked by an electrician.\n\n• Inspect extension cords for frayed or exposed wires or loose plugs.\n\n• Make sure outlets have cover plates and no exposed wiring.\n\n• Make sure wiring does not run under rugs, over nails, or across high-traffic areas.\n\n• Do not overload extension cords or outlets. If you need to plug in two or three appliances, get a UL-approved unit with built-in circuit breakers to prevent sparks and short circuits.\n\n• Make sure insulation does not touch bare electrical wiring.\n\nOther Precautions\n\n• Sleep with your door closed.\n\n• Install fire extinguishers in your residence and teach family members how to use them.\n\n• Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your residence.\n\n• Ask your local fire department to inspect your residence for fire safety and prevention.\n\n• Make buildings accessible to water source\n\nDuring a Fire:\n\nIf your clothes catch on fire, you should:\n\n• Stop, drop, and roll - until the fire is extinguished. Running only makes the fire burn faster.\n\nTo escape a fire, you should:\n\n• Check closed doors for heat before you open them. If you are escaping through a closed door, use the back of your hand to feel the top of the door, the doorknob, and the crack between the door and door frame before you open it. Never use the palm of your hand or fingers to test for heat - burning those areas could impair your ability to escape a fire (i.e., ladders and crawling).\n\nHot Door Cool Door\n\nDo not open. Escape through a window. If you cannot escape, hang a white or light-colored sheet outside the window, alerting fire fighters to your presence. Open slowly and ensure fire and/or smoke is not blocking your escape route. If your escape route is blocked, shut the door immediately and use an alternate escape route, such as a window. If clear, leave immediately through the door and close it behind you. Be prepared to crawl. Smoke and heat rise. The air is clearer and cooler near the floor.\n\n• Crawl low under any smoke to your exit - heavy smoke and poisonous gases collect first along the ceiling.\n\n• Close doors behind you as you escape to delay the spread of the fire.\n\n• Stay out once you are safely out. Do not reenter.\n\nAfter a Fire\n\n• If you are with burn victims, or are a burn victim yourself, cool and cover burns to reduce chance of further injury or infection.\n\n• If you detect heat or smoke when entering a damaged building, evacuate immediately.\n\n• If you are a tenant, contact the landlord.\n\n• If you have a safe or strong box, do not try to open it. It can hold intense heat for several hours. If the door is opened before the box has cooled, the contents could burst into flames.\n\n• If you must leave your home because a building inspector says the building is unsafe, ask someone you trust to watch the property during your absence.\n\nWildfires:\n\nWild land fires are classified into three categories:\n\n• A surface fire: is the common type and burns along the floor of a forest, moving slowly and killing or damaging the trees;\n\n• A ground fire: is usually started by lightning and burns on or below the forest floor;\n\n• A crown fire: spreads rapidly by winds and moves quickly by jumping along the top of trees. Wildland fires are usually signaled by dense smoke that fills the area for miles around.\n\nIf heavy rains follow a fire, other natural disasters can occur, including landslides, mudflows, and floods. Once ground cover has been burned away, little is left to hold soil in place on steep slopes and hillsides. If the wild land fire destroyed the ground cover, then erosion becomes one of several potential problems.\n\nProtective Measures\n\nBefore a Wildfire to prepare for wildfires, you should:\n\n• Mark the entrance to your property with address signs that are clearly visible from the road.\n\n• Keep lawns trimmed, leaves raked, and the roof and rain gutters free from debris such as dead limbs and leaves.\n\n• Stack firewood at least 30 feet away from your residence.\n\n• Store flammable materials, liquids, and solvents in metal containers outside your residence at least 30 feet away from structures and wooden fences.\n\n• Create defensible space by thinning trees and brush within 30 feet around your residence. Beyond 30 feet, remove dead wood, debris, and low tree branches.\n\n• Landscape your property with fire resistant plants and vegetation to prevent fire from spreading quickly. For example, hardwood trees are more fire-resistant than pine, evergreen, eucalyptus, or fir trees.\n\n• Make sure water sources, such as hydrants, ponds, swimming pools, and wells, are accessible to the fire department.\n\n• Use fire resistant, protective roofing and materials like stone, brick, and metal to protect your residence. Avoid using wood materials.\n\n• Cover all exterior vents, attics, and eaves with metal mesh screens to prevent debris from collecting and to help keep sparks out.\n\n• Install multi-pane windows, tempered safety glass, or fireproof shutters to protect large windows from radiant heat.\n\n• Use fire-resistant draperies for added window protection.\n\n• Have chimneys, wood stoves, and all home heating systems inspected and cleaned annually by a certified specialist.\n\n• Insulate chimneys and place spark arresters on top. The chimney should be at least 3 feet above the roof.\n\n• Remove branches hanging above and around the chimney.\n\nFollow Local Burning Laws\n\n• Before burning debris in a wooded area, make sure you notify local authorities, obtain a burning permit, and follow these guidelines:\n\n• Use an approved incinerator with a safety lid or covering with holes no larger than 3/4 inch.\n\n• Create at least a 10-foot clearing around the incinerator before burning debris.\n\n• Have a fire extinguisher or garden hose on hand when burning debris.\n\nDuring a Wildfire:\n\nIf a wildfire threatens your home and time permits, take the following precautions:\n\n• Shut off gas at the meter. Only a qualified professional can safely turn the gas back on.\n\n• Turn off propane tanks.\n\n• Place combustible patio furniture inside.\n\n• Connect garden hose to outside taps. Place lawn sprinklers on the roof and near above-ground fuel tanks. Wet the roof.\n\n• Wet or remove shrubs within 15 feet of your residence.\n\n• Gather fire tools such as a rake, axe, handsaw or chainsaw, bucket, and shovel.\n\n• Back your car into the garage or park it in an open space facing the direction of escape.\n\n• Shut doors and roll up windows. Leave the key in the ignition and the car doors unlocked. Close garage windows and doors, but leave them unlocked. Disconnect automatic garage door openers.\n\n• Open fireplace damper. Close fireplace screens.\n\n• Close windows, vents, doors, blinds or noncombustible window coverings, and heavy drapes. Remove flammable drapes and curtains.\n\n• Move flammable furniture into the center of the residence away from windows and sliding-glass doors.\n\n• Close all interior doors and windows to prevent drafts.\n\n• Place valuables that will not be damaged by water in a pool or pond.\n\nIf advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Choose a route away from the fire hazard. Watch for changes in the speed and direction of the fire and smoke.\n\nRisk of Morbidity and Mortality\n\nMorbidity and mortality associated with wildfires include burns, inhalation injuries, respiratory complications, and stress-related cardiovascular events (exhaustion and myocardial infarction from fighting or fleeing the fire).\n\nPublic Health Interventions\n\nMore than four out of every five wildfires are started by people. Negligent human behavior, such as smoking in forested areas or improperly extinguishing campfires, are the causes of many forest fires. Another cause of forest fires is lightning. Prevention efforts include working with the fire service to educate people to:\n\n• Build fires away from nearby trees or bushes,\n\n• Be prepared to extinguish fire quickly and completely.\n\n• Never leave a fire-even a burning cigarette-unattended.\n\n• Encourage the development of a family wildfire evacuation plan if the area in your community is at risk for wildfire.\n\n2.14. Explosions\n\nExplosions can inflict multi-system life-threatening injuries to many persons simultaneously. Contributing factors include the composition and amount of the materials involved the environment in which the event occurs, the method of delivery, such as a bomb, the distance between the victim and the blast, and the absence/presence of protective barriers or environmental hazards in the area of the blast.\n\nTo predict subsequent demand for medical care and resources needed, it is useful to remember that post-blast, half of the initial casualties will seek medical care over the first one-hour period. Those with minor injuries often arrive before the most severely injured, because they go directly to the closest hospitals using whatever transportation is available. Further, where the explosion has resulted in a structural collapse, victims will be more severely injured and their rescue can occur over prolonged time periods.\n\nMorbidity and Mortality\n\nThe most common injuries for survivors of explosions are penetrating and blunt trauma. Blast lung is the most common fatal injury among initial survivors. Explosions in confined spaces (mines, buildings, or large vehicles) and/or structural collapse are associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Blast injuries can occur to any body system: auditory, digestive, circulatory, central nervous system, extremities, renal, and respiratory. Up to 10 percent of all blast survivors have significant eye injuries. These injuries can occur with minimal discomfort initially and patients can come for care days, weeks, or even months after the event. Symptoms include eye pain or irritation, foreign body sensation, altered vision, periorbital swelling, or contusions. Clinical findings in the gastrointestinal tract may be absent until the onset of complications. Victims can also experience tinnitus, and/or temporary or permanent deafness from blasts.\n\nPublic Health Interventions\n\no Identify the medical institutions and personnel who can provide emergency care\n\no Ensure that the community preparedness plan includes structure for surge capacity. To estimate the "first wave" of casualties, double the number appearing for care in the first hour. Prepare written communications and instructions for victims who may experience temporary or permanent deafness.\n\no Work with the regional Emergency Management Organization, police, fire, etc to have a plan in place to identify potential toxic exposures and environmental hazards for which the health department will need to help protect responders in the field and the community.\n\no With the hospital community, establish a victim identification registry.\n\no With the mental health community, plan for the reception and intervention with family and friends.\n\nExercises:\n\n1.

Introduction\n\nHuman and economic losses due to natural disasters have continued to increase despite efforts undertaken by Governments and the international community to raise awareness of risk reduction needs, in particular fostered by the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR, 1990-1999). Global summaries for 2002 indicated the occurrence of over 500 disasters, with more than\n\n10,000 people killed, 600 million people affected, US$ 55 billion in total damages and US$ 13 billion in insured losses. Developing countries are disproportionately affected, with their losses rising to about five times higher per unit of GDP than for rich countries, sometimes exceeding a year or more of hard-won and desperately needed economic development.\n\nThe underlying problems of growing vulnerability to natural and technological hazards are largely outcome of short-sighted development activities. Every day development decisions are being made at local, national and international levels. Despite their importance, these developmental activities are more often factors that increase the vulnerability to hazard than reducing the risk. In other words, the vulnerability of communities is growing due to human activities that lead to increased poverty, greater urban density, environmental degradation and climate change. In addition to the aforementioned, the prominent consequences of disasters are summarized under the following headings:\n\n3.2. Social reactions\n\nThe nature of disasters may intensify reactions of persons impacted by the event. The scope of the event, personal loss or injuries, and traumatic stimuli, all serve to impact reactions. Though reactions to disasters may vary between individuals, there are common reactions that are normal reactions to the abnormal event. Sometimes these stress reactions appear immediately following the disaster; in some cases, they are delayed for a few hours, a few days, weeks, or even months. These stress reactions may be categorized as physiological, cognitive/intellectual, emotional, and behavioral symptoms and may include the following:\n\nPhysiological Symptoms\n\n• Fatigue\n\n• Shock symptoms\n\n• Nausea\n\n• Headaches\n\n• Vomiting\n\n• Profuse sweating\n\n• Fine motor tremors\n\n• Chills\n\n• Teeth grinding\n\n• Muscle aches\n\n• Dizziness\n\nCognitive/Intellectual Symptoms\n\n• Memory loss\n\n• Concentration problems/distractibility\n\n• Reduced attention span\n\n• Decision making difficulties\n\n• Calculation difficulties\n\n• Confusing trivial with major issues\n\nEmotional Symptoms\n\n• Anxiety\n\n• Feeling overwhelmed\n\n• Grief\n\n• Identification with victims\n\n• Depression\n\n• Anticipation of harm to self or others\n\n• Irritability\n\nBehavioral Symptoms\n\n• Insomnia\n\n• Crying easily\n\n• Substance abuse\n\n• Gallows humor\n\n• Gait change\n\n• Ritualistic behavior\n\n• Hyper vigilance\n\n• Unwillingness to leave scene\n\nAlthough these may be normal reactions to the event, persons providing disaster mental health services should recognize when reactions are severe enough to refer an individual for services of a mental health professional.\n\n3.3. Factors which may affect reactions\n\n• Lack of warning\n\n• Scope of the event\n\n• Abrupt contrast of scene\n\n• Personal loss or injury\n\n• Type of disaster\n\n• Traumatic stimuli\n\n• Nature of the destructive agent\n\n• Human error\n\n• Time of occurrence\n\n• Lack of opportunity for effective action\n\n• Degree of uncertainty\n\n• Properties of the post-disaster and duration of threat\n\n• Environment (temperature, humidity, pollution…)\n\nHost Related Factors\n\nAlthough specific factors intensify reactions, there are personal risk factors that people often possess prior to the disaster/emergency that make them more vulnerable to disaster-precipitated stress. People often have preexisting stress prior to the disaster/emergency. This stress makes them more vulnerable to the challenges that a disaster/emergency situation brings.\n\nHealth\n\n• Disabled: physical, sight, hearing, speech\n\n• Health and medical problems, receiving medication\n\nSocial\n\n• Lack of support networks, divorced, widowed\n\n• Cultural: language barriers, norms and fears about receiving help in dealing with the system\n\nDemographic\n\n• Age: younger and older have more difficulties\n\n• Sex: women report more stress than men but little differences have been found in immune and endocrine responses\n\nPast History\n\n• Past disaster experience/traumatic events\n\n• Past mental illness or emotional problems\n\n3.4. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF DISASTER\n\n3.4.1. Sexual violence\n\nRape is increasingly recognized as a feature of internal wars, but it could as well be experienced in many different types of conflicts. In some conflicts, rape has been used systematically as an attempt to undermine the opposing groups. Rape, sexual violence, and exploitation may also be widespread in refugee camps, although the extent of its recognition is limited, widely varying estimates of the numbers of victims have been reported.\n\nIn addition to the long-lasting mental health disorders, rapes have resulted in the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). War and political conflict present high risk situations for the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV. There are various ways in which war predisposes to STI and HIV transmission, such as:\n\n• widespread population movement, causing increased crowding;\n\n• separation of women from partners normally providing protection;\n\n• abuses and sexual demands by military personnel and others in positions of power;\n\n• Weakened social structures, there by reducing inhibitions on aggressive behavior and violence against women.\n\nAside from these additional exposures, access to barrier contraceptives, to treatment for STIs, to the prerequisites for maintaining personal hygiene, and to health promotion advice are all compromised in conflict situations.\n\nHuman right violations:\n\nViolations of human rights law and international humanitarian law that targets individuals can take many forms such as torture of civilian, physical and psychological harms to individuals do not end with the cessation of hostilities, sex trafficking, child labour, denying basic needs, etc.\n\nThe impact of disaster will also include indirect causes, such as food scarcity, population displacement, destruction of health facilities, and disruption of routine curative and preventive services.\n\n3.4.2. Population Displacement\n\nPopulation displacement due to environmental degradation is not a recent phenomenon. Historically, people have had to move from their land because it had been degraded (through natural disasters, war or over-exploitation) and could not sustain them. What is more recent is the potential for mass movements caused by population growth, resource depletion and the irreversible destruction of the environment. Environmental disasters such as floods, droughts and earthquakes are displacing more and more people every year. People and governments of many nations are altering the physical environment in a way that makes it more vulnerable to disruption. For example, rapid rates of population growth and high levels of consumption in affluent states have resulted in the overutilisation and degradation of the land. As deforestation, desertification, global warming, and other threats appear, a new category of displaced people is being recognized - the environmentally displaced.\n\nMass population movement is due primarily to war, famine, drought or combination of these factors. Such migration predisposes large number to overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, malnutrition, and diseases for which they may not be immune. The highest morbidity and mortality rates occur in the mass displacements of populations in areas of limited resources during the acute phase of disaster. Measles, diarrheal illness (eg. cholera) and acute upper respiratory infection have emerged as the most common causes of infectious diseases - related deaths among refuge and internally displaced populations in 1990s. For example, Somalia and Rwanda provide the most devastating large scale mortality rates from infectious diseases in mass population displacements. In such situations, the crude death is inevitably higher in the refugee population than the base crude death rate of the host population.\n\nIn general, the variety of possible situations displaced persons may be experienced, in varying degrees, are summarized as follows:\n\n• Loss of means of livelihood;\n\n• Communities becoming separated from any services previously provided;\n\n• Loss of normal sources of food;\n\n• Lack of shelter and household necessities;\n\n• Lack of fuel for cooking;\n\n• Lack of potable water;\n\n• Communicable diseases and overcrowding;\n\n• Additional burdens particularly for women heads of households;\n\n• Possibly large numbers of unaccompanied children;\n\n• Loss of land tenure;\n\n• Possible communication and logistics problems;\n\n• Insecurity due to tension and military activities.\n\n3.4.3. Communicable diseases\n\nIn general, the risks of large scale epidemics are low immediately following acute natural disasters, particularly in the developed world.\n\no Infectious disease outbreaks usually occur in the post impact and recovery phases and not during the acute phase.\n\no The risks of epidemics increase; however, if drought, famine, and large displacements of people are involved. These risks will be minimized if potable water; safe food; sanitation services including human and animal wastes removal; adequate personal hygiene; vector control; maintenance of routine immunization programs; sufficient space and ventilation in shelters and temporary housing; and the isolation of patients with communicable diseases are provided.\n\n3.4.4. Climatic exposure\n\nTo a large extent, public health depends on safe drinking water, sufficient food, secure shelter, and good social conditions. A changing climate is likely to affect all of these conditions. Overall, however, the health effects of a rapidly changing climate are likely to be overwhelmingly negative, particularly in the poorest communities, which have contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions. Marked and short-term fluctuations in weather can cause acute adverse health effects; including the following:\n\n• Extremes of both heat and cold can cause potentially fatal illnesses, e.g. heat stress or hypothermia, as well as increasing death rates from heart and respiratory diseases.\n\n• In cities, stagnant weather conditions can trap both warm air and air pollutants -- leading to smog episodes with significant health impacts.\n\n• These effects can be significant. For example abnormally high temperatures in Europe in the summer of 2003 were associated with at least 27,000 more deaths than the equivalent period in previous years.\n\nOther weather extremes, such as heavy rains, floods, and hurricanes, also have severe impacts on health. Approximately 600,000 deaths occurred world-wide as a result of weather-related natural disasters in the 1990s; and some 95% of these were in poor countries.\n\n• In October 1999, a cyclone in Orissa, India, caused 10,000 deaths. The total number of people affected was estimated at 10-15 million;\n\n• In December 1999, floods in and around Caracas, Venezuela, killed approximately 30,000 people, many in shanty towns on exposed slopes.\n\nMeasurement of health effects from climate change can only be very approximate. Nevertheless, a WHO quantitative assessment, taking into account only a subset of the possible health impacts, concluded that the effects of the climate change that has occurred since the mid-1970s may have caused over 150,000 deaths in 2000. It also concluded that these impacts are likely to increase in the future.\n\n3.4.5. Food shortage and malnutrition\n\nFamine and decreased per-capita food production in general can result from natural disasters (e.g. extensive flooding, prolonged drought, or gradual change in climate) or armed conflicts. In fact, in conflict areas food procurement and distribution have been used as a weapon of war. In Africa, drought permanently threatens 460 million people (see figure 5 below).\n\nFigure 7 Drought Prone Countries in Africa\n\n3.4.6. Mental Health:\n\nPost traumatic stress disorder:\n\nEach disaster presents a slightly different profile of emotional trauma. However, some trends are predictable. All persons involved\n\nKey:\n\nDrought Prone are\n\nNon-drprone a\n\nwith a disaster will suffer to some degree from the emotional trauma. Human-created disasters seem to cause a more intense reaction than those of natural occurrence. The most consistent positive predictor of significant symptoms is the degree of direct involvement in the disaster.\n\nRisk factors for post traumatic stress disorder development after disaster:\n\n• intense exposure to death and injury;\n\n• exposure of survivors to dead bodies;\n\n• overwhelming life threatening danger;\n\n• unexpected or first exposure to disaster;\n\n• intense initial phase (prolonged stress);\n\n• manmade disaster with no warning;\n\n• high impact ratios;\n\n• dependence on outside agencies;\n\n• exposure to prolonged stress.\n\nTime course of post traumatic stress disorder:\n\nThe development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be delayed from one week to three years, and it is divided into three stages.\n\n• Stage one is associated with an adrenergic surge that occurs acutely, but persons rarely dwell long term on the incident. It may last up to one month, and, if symptoms last more than six weeks, the patients are considered to have been entered stage two.\n\n• Stage two is characterized by a sense of helplessness and a loss of self-control. Autonomic and somatic manifestations dominate. Moreover, it is accompanied by lifestyle and personality changes.\n\n• Stage three is characterized by profound despondency and demoralization.\n\nPrognosis:\n\nOverall, the majority (70% to 90%) of the patients with PTSD will do well: 30% rapidly, 40 % manifest mild symptoms, 20% manifest moderate symptoms, 10% don\'t recover or get worse. Patients with a good prognosis are those with a rapid onset and a short duration of symptoms. These people usually have strong social net work, and usually they have participated in one form of formal process of trying to resolve the emotional content of an incident in order to prevent PTSD.\n\n3.4.6.1. Children in disasters:\n\nThe actual degree of emotional trauma among children is usually underestimated after disaster. The most important reasons for this are:\n\n• Most studies to date have had significant methodological flaws.\n\n• Parents are either unaware or unwilling to admit any inability to protect their children from stress, and therefore they under report it.\n\n• The extrapolation of emotional status from non-disaster events to disaster may also give false evaluation of the level of the symptoms in children.\n\n• Most of the childhood emotional effects of disaster are age-related.\n\nThe impact of disaster on children should be thought of in terms of their developmental age and not their chronologic age. Preschoolers are still exercising some normal separation anxiety. Disaster will increase the normal feelings. Increased arousal, sleep disturbances, clinging and fear of being alone all become manifest. School-age children tend to be less dependent on their parents. As such their response to the stress of a disaster may be less consistent. They may exhibit reckless behavior and may experience psychosomatic complaints. Adolescents, who are independent, often become involved in productive activities, such as rescue and recovery work. Some; however, may regress and may display withdrawn functioning under significant denial. Normal adolescent anxiety may be increased particularly if they identify with the victims.\n\nRisk factors of an increased emotional trauma in children:\n\n• high intensity event;\n\n• injury to the child;\n\n• loss of parent or significant person;\n\n• fear of death, separation and recurrence of the disaster;\n\n• insecurity, lack of support;\n\n3.4.6.2. The elderly in disasters:\n\nThe elderly are indeed at an increased risk for physical injury in some circumstances, but they are not necessarily at an increased risk for psycho emotional disorder. However, the impact of the loss of spouse, relative, or even a pet may be greater in the elderly. Another factor is the loss of self-reliance. In some cases the disruption of normal routines and living environment may result in confusion and aberrant behavior. However, the life experience of the elderly may be a valuable resource during the recovery phase of the disaster. They often have more realistic expectations of what their recovery needs are.\n\nTreatment:\n\nMental health professionals, including psychiatrists, and psychologists, are regarded as the principal providers of care to the PTSD patients. Psychotherapy and behavioral therapy are generally thought necessary, and they have yielded good results, in addition, some patients may benefit from psychotropic medications.\n\n3.4.6.3. Rescue workers in disaster:\n\nThe most common secondary victims of a disaster are those providing care to the victims. These include not only rescue and search personnel but also physicians, nurses and other staff. The stress reactions seen in non-professionals involved in disaster response resemble the symptoms seen in primary victims. Many professional responders also report serious symptoms following disaster. Rescue workers will have more intense emotional trauma if they are involved in a failed rescue attempts (especially if children are involved). However, up to 90% of the professionals involved will have good coping skills.\n\nThe most serious reactions occur among rescue workers involved with body handling. These are due to in part the profound sensory stimulation experienced by these personnel. Inexperienced body handlers have significantly more symptoms than those with previous experience. Symptoms can also be correlated with number of bodies encountered by the rescue worker\n\nAdditional symptoms of PTSD in professional disaster worker are decreased by:\n\n• ability to judge risk;\n\n• leadership ability;\n\n• efficiency;\n\n• ability to work cooperatively.\n\nFactors for decreasing PTSD symptoms in disaster workers are:\n\n• prior disaster training;\n\n• specific disaster education;\n\n• maturity;\n\n• experience with prior disasters;\n\n• Leadership type (good leadership).\n\nCoping methods for disaster recovery workers include:\n\n• To avoid humanization of the bodies;\n\n• not to look at the faces;\n\n• not to learn the name of the victims;\n\n• to concentrate on the tasks at hand;\n\n• to concentrate on the benefit to the society.\n\nIn disaster people loose loved ones, relatives and property. Above all, in psychological terms, they lose faith - not religious faith, but faith in the fact that life has a certain consistency and meaning.\n\n3.4.7. Five experiences borne by survivors are:\n\n• The death imprint: it consists of indelible imaginary of the encounter with death, intruding whilst awake, or during sleep in the form of nightmares. It comprises considerations of experience - images of the impact such as the sight of bodies dismembered or crushed, the sounds of screaming, or the smell of burning flesh.\n\n• Survivor guilt: when the person questions why they survived when other did not, can be of two sorts:\n\no There is what might be called "existential guilt". Here, the person dwells in a very general way on their survival - \'why me?\' or \'why did God choose me?\' perhaps, \'why me when I am old and so many children died?\'\n\no Guilt may be focused on actions or their absence - \'Did I do enough, could I have saved more people? Guilt may be especially intense when parents survive their children, or where there is competition for survival.\n\n• Psychic numbing: it is manoeuvre, presenting survivors from experiencing the reality of the catastrophic destruction and death about them, and the massive personal threat implied.\n\no It blocks the experience of too much unbearable pain at any time, and its first manifestations are present in the so called \'disaster syndrome\', where immediately following the impact, behaving remarkable calmly.\n\no They may seem to be in control and coping bravely\n\n- in fact, they have not yet to react. They are behaving as though they are calm observers of someone else\'s experience.\n\n• Nurturance conflicts: refers to suspicion of offers from outsiders and in particular to the experience of distrust, the fear that such offers may be false.\n\no Survivors may become \'touchy and sensitive to the response of others\'.\n\no Develop \'a form of severe victim-consciousness\' which sometimes reaches the level of paranoia.\n\n• Quest for meaning: the survivors need to make a \'formulation\' of their experience in the attempt to explain and gain mastery over it. Formulation is a key element of psychological processing and hence of much psychological treatment of trauma. The survivors\' search to understand the experience of the disaster exists on a number of levels, which might be termed as \'hierarchy of formulation\'. In terms of development of understanding over time, a psychological sequence might be:\n\nMutual assistance and disaster intervention programs may significantly limit the impact of disaster on the community. International assistance is difficult to manage and coordinate but may make a decisive difference in the outcome, especially in countries and areas with very limited resources.\n\n3.5. Development and Disasters\n\nFor a long time the cause and effect relationship between disasters and social and economic development was ignored. Development planners hoped that disasters would not occur and, if they did, were most effectively handled by relief from donor countries and relief organizations. Disasters were seen in the context of emergency response-not as a part of long term development programming. When a disaster did occur, the response was directed to emergency needs and cleaning up.\n\nThe growing body of knowledge on the relationships between disasters and development indicates four basic themes. The themes may be expanded as follows:\n\n• Disasters set back development programming, destroying years of development initiatives.\n\n• Rebuilding after a disaster provides significant opportunities to initiate development programs.\n\n• Development programs can increase a particular area\'s susceptibility to disasters. A major increase in livestock development leads to overgrazing, which contributes to desertification and increased vulnerability to famine.\n\n• Development programs can be designed to decrease susceptibility to disasters and their negative consequences. Housing projects constructed under building codes designed to withstand high winds result in less destruction during the next tropical storm.\n\n3.5.1 Disruption of Development by Disasters:\n\nDisasters can seriously disrupt development initiatives in several ways, including:\n\n• Loss of resources\n\n• Interruption of programs\n\n• Impact on investment\n\n• Impact on the non-formal sector\n\n• Political destabilization\n\nLoss of Resources: Development resources are lost when a disaster wipes out the products of investment. It shortens the life of development investments.\n\nInterruption of Programs: Disasters interrupt ongoing programs and divert resources from originally planned uses.\n\nImpact on Investment Climate: Investors need a climate of stability and certainty to be encouraged not to risk their money.\n\nImpact on Non-Formal Sector: Disasters depress the non-formal economy through the direct costs of lost equipment and housing (which often also serves as business sites). The indirect costs of disasters include lost employment, and lost income. Sometimes the importation of relief items creates disincentives to producers.\n\nPolitical Destabilization: The stress to a country caused by a disaster often results in the destabilization of the government. This may occur for several reasons. For example, mismanagement of the disaster relief and recovery, or the survivors may have had unmet expectations.\n\n3.5.2 How Development May Cause Disasters\n\nDevelopment projects implemented without taking into account existing environmental hazards may increase vulnerability to natural disasters. For example, projects designed to increase employment opportunities, and thus income, usually attract additional population growth. Low-income people may then have to seek housing in areas previously avoided, on hillsides or in floodplains. The cost of relief assistance after a landslide or flood can easily outweigh the benefits to the economy of more jobs. Similarly, development projects may lead to negative political consequences that increase the vulnerability to civil conflict.\n\n3.5.3 Development opportunities afforded by disasters\n\nDisaster can serve as a catalyst for introducing mitigation activities. Disasters often create a political and economic atmosphere wherein extensive changes can be made more rapidly than under normal circumstances. For example, in the aftermath of a disaster, there may be major opportunities to execute land reform programs, to improve the overall housing stock, to create new jobs and job skills, and to expand and modernize the economic base of the community - opportunities that would not otherwise be possible.\n\nDisasters can also highlight high-risk areas where action must be taken before another disaster strikes. The realization of vulnerability can motivate policy-makers and the public to participate in mitigation activities. Disasters may also serve to highlight the fact that the country is seriously under-developed. They can thus bring in funding and the attention of donor communities to apply to long-term development needs (Henderson, 1990).\n\nExercises:\n\n1.

These activities are categorized as disaster preparedness, disaster response, disaster recovery, post disaster epidemiological surveillance, environmental management and disaster mitigation. The details of these activities are treated in the subsequent sections of this chapter.\n\nAims of disaster management are to:\n\n• Reduce (avoid, if possible) the potential losses from hazards;\n\n• Assure prompt and appropriate assistance to victims when necessary;\n\n• Achieve rapid and durable recovery.\n\n4.2 Disaster preparedness\n\nDisaster preparedness is defined as a state of readiness to respond to a disaster, crisis, or any other type of emergency situation. More broadly it is stated as the leadership, training, readiness and exercise support, and technical and financial assistance to strengthen citizens, communities, state, local and tribal governments professional emergency workers as they prepare for disaster, mitigate the effects of disaster, respond to community needs after a disaster, and launch effective recovery efforts (www.fema.gov).\n\nAll measures and policies taken before an event occurs that allow for prevention, mitigation, and readiness constitutes disaster preparedness. Preparedness includes designing warning systems, planning for evacuation, and reallocation, storing food and water, building temporary shelters, devising management strategies, and holding disaster drills and exercises,. Contingency planning is also included in preparedness as well as planning for post-impact response and recovery.\n\nThe aim of disaster preparation is to be able to reduce the immediate mortality and morbidity with a better prepared, well equipped service. The preparation includes early warning systems for seasonal changes in climate, and risk of flood or drought, such as electronic information systems and satellites that can provide information over large regions and continents. Separate systems are needed to cater for the agricultural sector, cities and people in rural or remote communities. The public health infrastructure is particularly important for the immediate measures needed and for public information on reducing the health risks.\n\nThe most important challenge is to change from concentrating solely on post-disaster relief and to focus on pre-disaster preparedness. Thanks to disaster-preparedness schemes, particularly to an increasingly sophisticated early warning system, the comparative losses of life due to weather-related disasters are declining. All the evidence shows that, for every dollar spent on prevention and preparedness, about $100 or more is needed for relief efforts after the disaster has taken place.\n\nWhere such forecasting and warning systems are installed as part of disaster-management programs, evidence shows that more lives can be saved and damage is drastically reduced\n\nBeing prepared also means having thorough disaster contingency plans comprising of:\n\n• Covering emergency housing, repairs, replacement of essential equipment and protection of the most vulnerable people in the community: the sick, the very young and the old.\n\n• Improvement of water supply and sanitation systems\n\n• Logistics of the predicted need for health and social services need to be laid down in advance, including early warning systems to detect health effects.\n\n• Planning for climate change: as global warming and its effects on water will increase the frequency of water related disasters.\n\n• Public information and education: to ensure early warnings to communities at risk; and give information about how to conserve water and keep it safe from contamination.\n\nPreparedness consists of three basic steps: preparing a plan, training to the plan, and exercising the plan. Preparedness deals with the functional aspects of emergency management such as the response to and recovery from a disaster, whereas mitigation attempts to lessen these effects through pre-disaster actions as simple as striving to create "disaster-resistant" communities.\n\nPlanning for various disasters:\n\nTwo strategies for disaster planning include the agent-specific and the all-hazards approaches. In agent-specific planning, communities only plan for threats most likely to occur in their region. Since many disasters pose similar problems and similar tasks, an all-hazards approach involves planning for the common problems and tasks that arise in the majority of disasters.\n\nFigure 8 Phases of Disaster Management\n\nThe following are some of the means to plan for disastrous situations:\n\n• Escape routes\n\n• Family communications\n\n• Utility shut-off and safety\n\n• Insurance and vital records\n\n• Special needs\n\n• Safety Skills\n\nEscape Routes\n\nIdentify and prepare escape routes such as alternative doors, windows, and path ways.\n\nFamily Communications\n\nIt is important to contact police departments, Red-Cross, radio/Television (media) stations to find family members. Pick also a friend or relative who lives out-of- woredas, zone, and region for household members to notify that they are safe.\n\nUtility Shut-off and Safety\n\nIn the event of a disaster, you may be instructed to shut off the utility service at your home. Below is some general guidance for shutting off utility service:\n\nNatural Gas: Natural gas leaks and explosions are responsible for a significant number of fires following disasters. It is vital that all household members (who have natural gas) know how to shut off natural gas.\n\nWater: Water quickly becomes a precious resource following many disasters. It is vital that all household members (who have water pipe lie) learn how to shut off the water at the main house valve.\n\n• Cracked lines may pollute the water supply to your house. It is wise to shut off your water until you hear from authorities that it is safe for drinking.\n\nElectricity: Electrical sparks have the potential of igniting natural gas if it is leaking. It is wise to teach all responsible household members where and how to shut off the electricity.\n\nPreparing to Shut Off Electricity\n\n• Locate your electricity circuit box.\n\n• Teach all responsible household members how to shut off the electricity to the entire house.\n\nFor Your Safety: always shut off all the individual circuits before shutting off the main circuit breaker.\n\nInsurance and vital records:\n\nHouseholds should be encouraged to have insurance for property, health and life. Such vital records, including insurance, bank… books need to be kept in safe place.\n\nPlanning for Special Needs\n\nIf you have special needs, find out about special assistance that may be available in your community.\n\n• Create a network of neighbors, relatives, friends, and coworkers to aid you in an emergency. Discuss your needs and make sure everyone knows how to operate necessary equipment.\n\n• Discuss your needs with your employer.\n\n• If you are mobility impaired and live or work in a high-rise building, have an escape chair.\n\n• If you live in an apartment building, ask the management to mark accessible exits clearly and to make arrangements to help you leave the building.\n\n• Keep specialized items ready, including extra wheelchair batteries, oxygen, catheters, medication, food for service animals, and any other items you might need.\n\n• Be sure to make provisions for medications that require refrigeration.\n\n• Keep a list of the type and model numbers of the medical devices you require.\n\nAdditionally, under each specific disaster, the necessary preparedness to be made is discussed accordingly and readers are advised to refer to chapter two for more information regarding specific disaster.\n\n4.3 Disaster Response\n\nResponse is the immediate reaction to disaster. It may occur as the disaster is anticipated, as well as soon after it begins. Examples include mass evacuation, sandbagging buildings and other structures, securing emergency food and water, covering windows, providing emergency medical services, search and rescue, firefighting, and restoring public order to prevent looting.\n\nExtrication, triage, stabilization, and transport\n\nExtrication has evolved into a fire services function in most of the country. In addition to specialized technical and trench rescue teams, fire services have more experience with building collapse and secondary hazards (eg, floods, fires) than other organizations.\n\nThe concept of triage involves providing the most help for as many as possible. Medical personnel are accustomed to providing extensive, definitive care to every patient. When confronted by a number of patients simultaneously in a disaster situation, it is easy to become overwhelmed, even for an experienced disaster worker. Triage must occur at multiple levels, and patients must be reassessed during every step of the process.\n\nTransport must be both organized and orchestrated.\n\nDefinitive scene management\n\nWhile scene control and containment may be relatively simple in a local, static disaster, dynamic and paralytic disasters may take several days to contain and stabilize. As the length of time of the disaster increases, additional resources must be made available, as rescue crews reach exhaustion, supplies become spent, and additional hazards develop.\n\nThere is often theoretical debate over when the response function ends and recovery function begins. For the time being, the response function is classified as the immediate actions to save lives, protect properties, and meet basic human needs.\n\nActivation\n\nNotification and initial response: During this phase, organizations involved in disaster response and the potentially affected populations are notified.\n\nOrganization of command and scene assessment: The prearranged command and staff structure for responding to the disaster should be arranged and initial communications nets established.\n\nEmergency Response Activities:\n\nEmergency response activities are those carried out during the actual emergency or immediately prior to it. This may involve evacuation of threatened communities, emergency assistance during the disaster, and actions taken in the immediate aftermath during the time when the community is rather disorganized and basic services and infrastructure are not fully functioning. Because the emergency period is both dramatic and traumatic, most attention by the press and international community is focused here. Yet in most disasters (with the exception of droughts and civil strife), the emergency passes rather quickly and, in reality, only accounts for a very small percentage of the total picture.\n\nTwelve tasks or problems are likely to occur in most disasters are summarized below:\n\n• Interorganizational coordination is important.\n\n• Sharing information among organizations,\n\n• Resource management,\n\n• When advance warnings are possible, evaluations from areas of danger can be the most effective life-saving strategy in disaster.\n\n• The public tends to underestimate risks and downplays warnings if messages are ambiguous or inconsistent.\n\n• Search and rescue\n\n• Using the mass media: to deliver warnings to the public and to educate the public\n\n• Triage: is a method of assigning priority for treatment and transport for injured citizens.\n\n• Casualty distribution: in most domestic disasters, several medical resources can handle the casualty distribution.\n\n• Patient tracking: is complicated by the fact that most persons evacuating their homes do not seek lodging in public shelters where their presence will be registered.\n\n• Caring for patients when the health care infrastructure has been damaged requires careful advance planning.\n\n• The management of volunteers and donations: is a common problem in disasters. Procedures should be established to manage large number of resources.\n\n• Plan for organized improvement in response to the disruption of shelter, utilities, communication systems, and transportation.\n\n4.4. Declaration of disaster:\n\nThe social disorganization surrounding a disaster and the number and types of responding organizations and groups create the need for a well-ordered mass response system. Consequently, a complex organizational environment has to be developed to respond in disaster situations. To mobilize these organizations, a declaration of disaster is initiated according to an increasing level of emergency (disaster).\n\nDisaster shall be declared when convincing and complete socioeconomic reports from regional councils and the National Early\n\nWarning System are provided. National level declaration for disaster will be made only by the National Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Committee (NDPPC). The commencement of relief measures shall automatically follow the declaration of disaster in the area. However, it is not always necessary to wait such formal declaration, or NDPPC\'s decisions on measures to be taken. Having regard to the policies of the Government, relief operation may commence with the available local resource before a formal declaration if the state of distress warrants immediate intervention. Subject to its enforcement by NDPPC and depending on the context of the disaster, the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) may also authorize certain essential measures to be taken in such situations.\n\n4.5. Disaster Recovery (Rehabilitation and Reconstruction):\n\nThe primary aim of recovery is to assist the affected community to regain a proper level of functioning following a disaster both initially and in the long term. It is "the coordinated process of supporting emergency-affected communities in reconstruction of the physical infrastructure and restoration of emotional, social, and physical well-being" (Emergency Management Australia, 2004). Recovery essentially concerns rehabilitation as well as developing the tools to mitigate against the future impact of a disaster, and should return the community to an improved state of post-disaster. This includes those activities that continue beyond the emergency period to restore lifelines. Examples include providing temporary shelters, restoring power, critical stress debriefing for emergency responders and victims, job assistance, small business loans, and debris clearance.\n\nRecovery involves decisions and actions relative to rebuilding homes, replacing property, resuming employment, restoring business, and permanently repairing and rebuilding infrastructures. Since the recovery function has such long-lasting effects and usually high costs, the participants in the process are numerous. They include all levels of government, the business community, political leadership, community activists and individuals.\n\nThe recovery phase is frequently underemphasized in disaster plans, but it is crucial for the affected community. Recovery efforts should identify opportunities for community development, especially in terms of creating sustainable, safer, and more resilient communities.\n\nThe four elements of recovery are:\n\n1. Community recovery (including psychological recovery); 2. Infrastructure recovery (services and lifelines);\n\n3. Economy recovery (including financial and political considerations, and business continuity); 4. Environment recovery.\n\n1. Community recovery:\n\n• Have we considered the specific needs of our community? That is, the cultures, traditions, demographics, etc as identified.\n\n• What mechanisms and resources will be required to aid in the psychological recovery of the community?\n\n• What financial assistance is available to the community? For example, government payments and public appeals.\n\n• What government and non-government agencies would you consider necessary to rebuild your community following disaster?\n\n• What are likely to be the medical and health requirements of the community?\n\n2. Infrastructure recovery:\n\n• How will we ensure the restoration of essential services?\n\n• How will our community access essential services?\n\n• How will we ensure or facilitate restoration of living conditions and housing security?\n\n• How will we rebuild our community infrastructure? This includes ports, airports, dry storage, roads, public transport, fuel, gas, water, electricity, telecommunications, garbage and sewerage, waterways, parks, flora and fauna.\n\n• How will we communicate with our community and external agencies? This includes gathering, processing and circulating information to and from the community. It also encompasses communication with disaster workers (staff and volunteers), media, local government management, suppliers, groups and authorities including the local disaster management group.\n\n• Are our recovery plans adequately integrated and/or considerate of plans of other relevant services (such as health, energy, telecommunications, etc)?\n\n3. Economic recovery:\n\n• What impact will disaster have on job security in our community? (that is, both for displaced community members and volunteers in the recovery process.)\n\n• What mechanisms and resources will be required to assist and ensure the economic recovery of the community?\n\n• Who needs to be involved in re-establishing economic validity in our community?\n\n4. Environmental recovery:\n\n• What issues do we need to consider in preparing for and managing environmental damage caused by a disaster event?\n\n• Who needs to be involved in this process?\n\nPrinciples of disaster recovery and reconstruction:\n\nThree phases describe as to what happens to post-impact in the affected community:\n\n1. Emergency phase: activities should focus on saving lives through search and rescue, first aid, emergency medical assistance and over all disaster assessment. Efforts immediately begin to repair critical facilities, to restore communications, and transportation networks, and in some cases, to evacuate residents from areas still vulnerable to further disaster.\n\n2. Transition or recovery phase: during this phase, people return to work, repair damaged buildings and infrastructure, and initiate other actions that allow the community to return to their normal as soon as possible. Victims begin emotional recovery and may experience depression and post-traumatic disorder. 3. Reconstruction phase: is characterized by physical reordering of communications, utilities, roads and general environment. Residents repair or rebuild their housing and agricultural activities resume.\n\nCommunity participation is essential for planning the rehabilitation phase because local people better understand their own needs and the problems that create these needs.\n\n4.6 Disaster mitigation\n\nMitigation is defined as a sustained action to reduce or eliminate risk to people and property from hazards (disasters) and their effects. The function of mitigation differs from other emergency management disciplines since it looks at long-term solutions to reduce risk as opposed to preparedness for hazards, the immediate response to hazards, or the short-term recovery from a hazard event.\n\nDisaster mitigation includes those activities designed to prevent or reduce losses from disaster. It is usually considered the initial phase of emergency management, although it may be a component in the other phases. Examples include land-use planning, to limit or prevent development in floodplains, building codes to reduce losses from earthquakes and fires, dam and levees to prevent flooding.\n\nThe mitigation efforts must include:\n\n• Emergency housing, especially after floods, but also if drought has caused mass population movement in an attempt to find better water and food supplies.\n\n• Provision of emergency supplies of safe drinking water.\n\n• Emergency repairs to homes, drains and water supply and sanitation infrastructure.\n\n• Early warning systems to identify health effects and to detect rise in mosquito borne diseases, such as malaria, and diarrheal diseases, such as cholera.\n\nBoth disaster preparedness and its mitigation require multisectoral cooperation and joint planning. Both need evaluation after a disaster to reduce the ill effects of later crises.\n\nThe goal of mitigation is to create economically secure, socially stable, better built, and more environmentally sound communities that are out of harm\'s ways. The following widely accepted tools are used to reduce risks:\n\n• Hazard identification and mapping,\n\n• Design and construction applications\n\n• Land-use planning,\n\n• Finical incentives,\n\n• Insurance,\n\n• Structural controls.\n\nIn certain cases, some of the devastating effects of disasters can be reduced before the actual event. For example, evacuations may be orchestrated before hurricanes or floods. Early warning allows residents to seek shelter from tornadoes.\n\nDisaster Mitigation Strategies\n\nRisk Identification\n\nTo reduce the threat of droughts and to lessen their impact should they occur, a number of measures can be taken. The first step in disaster mitigation is to identify areas that are at risk to drought. Once the priority zones have been identified, comprehensive and integrated rural development programs should be initiated. Among the usual activities are:\n\n• Agricultural improvements including modifying cropping patterns and introduction of drought-resistant varieties of crops;\n\n• Rangeland management including improvement of grazing lands, and grazing patterns, introduction of feedlots, and protection of shrubs and trees.\n\n• Water resource development including improved irrigation, and water storage facilities, protection of surface water from evaporation, introduction of drip irrigation systems, and water containment methods such as retention dams and subsurface dams.\n\nAnimal husbandry activities including maintaining smaller herds, eliminating unproductive animals, and upgrading the quality and productivity of stock through improved breeding practices.\n\nLand-Use Planning\n\nAnother approach to reduce the impact of droughts on human settlements (including nomadic communities) is to employ land-use planning techniques.\n\nLand-use controls similar to zoning regulations could be created and adopted by governing bodies. These controls can include:\n\n• numbers of livestock per unit area;\n\n• maximum population density;\n\n• limits on amounts of water taken from public water supplies for agricultural or industrial use;\n\n• authority to declare a state of emergency during which time animal herds are required to be depleted or transported to non-emergency areas, more stringent water usage allowances are imposed, etc.\n\nImpediments to Mitigations\n\nThere are several factors, including denial of the risk, political will, cost and lack of funding.\n\n4.7. Post disaster epidemiological surveillance:\n\nPost-impact needs assessment provides information necessary to begin recovery. The first step is to assess community capacities and vulnerabilities, including physical environment (i.e. intact infrastructure, resources), social conditions (i.e. existing organizations, support, networks), and population attitude towards and motivation to recover. Communication must be established between the people affected by the disaster and the responding jurisdictions and organizations. Needs are determined by visiting representative areas, by talking to selected groups in affected communities, and by conducting rapid health assessment surveys.\n\nPrinciples of the undertaking are to:\n\n• Maximize use of pre-existing surveillance data for "baseline" information, and to modify conditions\n\n• Coordinate efforts after disaster with the normal surveillance activities in the health sector.\n\n• Avoid duplication of efforts\n\n• Be familiar with the epidemiology of endemic diseases and with the national surveillance system.\n\n• Coordinate the relief surveillance of communicable disease with activities of national health authorities.\n\n• Strengthen the reporting systems.\n\n• Strengthen the documentation system at the central level, in hospitals and clinics at the intermediate level.\n\nSteps in Epidemiologic Surveillance that should be taken before and after a Rapid-Onset Disaster\n\n1. Identification of the diseases and other conditions to be monitored, and selection of suitable indicators.\n\n2. Delineation of the areas affected by the disaster.\n\n3. Rapid statistical sampling of sites (ideally including unaffected localities for control purposes).\n\n4. Rapid, gross detection of cases or presumptive cases based on the presence of a symptom or complaint.\n\n5. Monitoring and reporting by local health services of the selected diseases or symptoms.\n\n6. Interpretation of data at the national level by a health unit of the disaster-affected country that is experienced in data analysis and has direct access to relief authorities.\n\n7. Investigation of any "unusual" occurrence of disease by local health workers, assisted when necessary by epidemiologists.\n\nRequirements\n\nFor surveillance to be most effective, there are four requirements.\n\n1. Establishment of priorities for investigating unusual occurrences of diseases, whether confirmed or rumored.\n\n2. Establishment of a mechanism for dissemination of surveillance information to both encourage taking of appropriate measures and discourage expenditure on inappropriate measures.\n\n3. Training and involvement of local health workers at all levels of the health system.\n\n4. Pre-disaster planning, including identification of real health risks in various disaster situations, assignment of responsibilities, and development of an assessment and surveillance plan.\n\nThe Collection, Interpretation and Utilization of Data\n\nParticipation of field health units in the surveillance system must be as complete as possible after a disaster. It is critical to motivate reporting units. The participation of units operating before the disaster should be continued when possible, with emphasis in reporting placed upon the diseases or symptom complexes targeted for surveillance. Health teams mobilized for the relief effort should be adequately briefed about the importance of surveillance. They should be given the case definitions to be used (according to IDSR) and be amply provided supplies of reporting forms.\n\nTwo operational aspects of data collection deserve emphasis. First is the importance of regularly sending "negative" reports whenever no patients with notifiable diseases are seen in a unit. A report form with a line of zeros provides valuable information. It also permits assessment of the number of units participating in the surveillance system. Failure to report, on the other hand, can either mean a lack of disease, or that a unit has dropped out of the surveillance effort. Speed of reporting is always critical in communicable disease surveillance and is especially vital following disaster. In general, weekly reporting from all units by telephone, telegraph or shortwave radio is preferable to reporting by mail. Immediate consultation about any unusual condition or suspected epidemic, at any time during the week, should be encouraged.\n\nInnovative ways to facilitate rapid reporting during the period of severe disruption in transportation and communication should be sought by members of the epidemiology unit. Egs include:\n\n• Daily or weekly radio reporting of selected diseases from the field;\n\n• The distribution and retrieval of reporting forms by members of the drug and/or food distribution system;\n\n• Gaining access to the national security force\'s communication network;\n\n• Incorporating disease surveillance into a more general regular report required by the relief coordinator;\n\n• Regular visit to field units by the epidemiologist-in-charge or a member of the surveillance team.\n\nIt is important that incoming notifications are evaluated immediately upon receipt by the epidemiology unit to provide prompt response to rumors or enquiries\n\nThe epidemiologists should also develop maps and graphs for visual appreciation of disease trends. This is frequently a more productive investment of the scarce time of staff members than is generating columns and figures. Maps with pins indicating the geographic clustering of cases are particularly useful for following the spread of a disease. Well charted graphs can more sensitively indicate disease trends than numbers.\n\nProviding Feedback to the Field from the Central Level\n\nProviding feedback is an important aspect of post-disaster surveillance. The weekly report provides more than feedback to field workers. The epidemiologist should ensure that the weekly report and adequate background information (personal visit or covering note) are circulated to the relief coordinator and other national authorities and local representatives of voluntary agencies. The overall relief coordinator should be responsible for distributing the report to members of the media and the community.\n\nPresenting Epidemiologic Information to Decision Makers\n\nIt is critical to present information from surveillance and the field investigations to key decision makers. Epidemiologic information, implications and an outline of alternatives of action must be summarized in non-technical terms understandable to lay people.\n\nSurveillance During and After the Recovery Phase\n\nWith increasing passage of time after a disaster, both decision makers and the public become progressively less concerned with the probability of epidemic disease. The phasing out of the intensified, disaster-related surveillance activities should take place after consultation with members of the national epidemiology group.\n\n4.8. Environmental health management\n\nThe impacts of disasters, whether natural or man-made, not only have human dimensions, but environmental ones as well. Environmental conditions may exacerbate the impact of a disaster, and vice versa, disasters have an impact on the environment. Deforestation, forest management practices, agriculture systems etc. can exacerbate the negative environmental impacts of a storm or typhoon, leading to landslides, flooding, silting and ground/surface water contamination.\n\nEmphasizing and reinforcing the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster management has become a critical priority, requiring the sound management of natural resources as a tool to prevent disasters or lessen their impacts on people, their homes and livelihoods.\n\nThere is a clear need to reinforce the importance of environmental concerns in the entire disaster management cycle of prevention, preparedness, assessment, mitigation and response and to integrate environmental concerns into planning for relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development. This will also require the enhancement of capacities to undertake short and medium-term activities in disaster management based on long-term environmental considerations.\n\nComprehensive understanding of natural systems coupled with the application of management tools such as environmental evaluation and risk assessment can make a major contribution to a reduction of risks and mitigation of any impacts.\n\nSpecifically, we need to examine the need for a multi-stakeholder partnership that links local governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations in order to facilitate more effective disaster prevention and mitigation.\n\nEnvironment management is a critical strategy to prevent disasters, and reduce risks/vulnerabilities of disaster prone countries and communities. Disaster risks and vulnerability can be considerably reduced through effective and long-term environmental and natural resource management practices.\n\nExercises:\n\n1.

The country has been drastically hit by and still is vulnerable to disasters due to various reasons such as low socio-economic development and hence inadequate action both to prevent and to respond to disasters. Among the frequent ones the following are worth mentioning: famine, drought, forced displacement (due to war, civil strives, political), floods, landslides, fires, epidemics (of human and animals), pests etc. Some of these will be discussed in detail as follows.\n\n5.2. Drought and Famine\n\nThe most serious impact of droughts can be the initiation of famine. Its importance warrants an in depth discussion. It should be regarded as a parallel disaster that will have parallel implications for preparedness, mitigation, and relief activities.\n\nDrought affects more people than any other environmental hazard. Yet, it is perhaps the most complex and least understood type of all environmental hazards. Drought is often seen as too little rain and used to be synonymous with famine. However, fluctuation in rain fall does not cause a famine. Drought often triggers a crisis in the arid and semi-arid areas, since rain is sparse and irregular, but alone does not cause desertification. The ecosystem changes leading to desertification are all attributed to human activities, such as over cultivation, deforestation, overgrazing, and unskilled irrigation. Each of these activities is exacerbated by increasing human populations. The first three activities strip the soil of vegetation and deplete its organic substances and nutrient.\n\nFamine is a disaster that occurs as the result of primarily drought, but it can also follow pestilence, windstorm, and human- induced catastrophes such as war and civil strife. Starvation is the result of food shortage. Famine and food emergencies are common events particularly in Africa, including Ethiopia and Asia, despite many intense and continuing efforts to address the problems. Drought-related famines appear to occur with cyclical frequency in many parts of Africa, both along the edges of deserts and in certain rain forest regions.\n\nFamines rarely occur unexpectedly. Food stocks are not often depleted or destroyed suddenly and simultaneously in large communities. More frequently, famine is predictable. In other words, the creeping onset of crop failure or food emergency is predictable from a series of meteorological, agricultural, political and/or economic indicators that may be monitored continuously. This process of famine preparedness through surveillance is a major function of the Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) headquartered in Rome. Thus, it is extremely important that:\n\n• indicators of an impending famine be closely monitored and measures taken quickly if it appears that a food shortage is developing;\n\n• priority be given to developing strong food and agricultural systems that provide an adequate fall-back resource in threatened areas.\n\nRegarding Ethiopia, most famines have concentrated geographically within two broad zones of the country. The first comprises of the central and northern high lands, stretching from northern previous Shewa through Wollo and Tigray. The second is made up of the crescent of low-lying, agro-pastoral lands ranging from Wollo in the north, through Hararge and Bale to Sidamo and Gamo-Gofa in the south. More than half of the crises of drought and famines have occurred in these two zones.\n\nEthiopia had previously suffered major drought and famine during the early 1970s. The late 1970s again brought signs of intensifying drought. By the early 1980s, large numbers of people in central Tigray, Wollo, and parts of Begemder (Gondar) and Shewa were beginning to feel the effects of renewed famine.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1984, northern Ethiopia had no rain to water crops or for drinking. By mid-1984 it was evident that another drought and resulting famine of major proportions had begun to affect large parts of northern Ethiopia. The almost total failure of crops in the north was compounded by fighting in and around Eritrea, which hindered the passage of relief supplies. Although international relief organizations made a major effort to provide food to the affected areas, the persistence of drought and poor security conditions in the north resulted in continuing need as well as hazards for famine relief workers.\n\nThe 1984 - 1985 famine in Ethiopia was significant in the history of the country. Drought and political instability contributed to the severity of the famine, which was estimated to have killed over one million people and the remaining were destitute. The people were deprived of basic needs such as food, shelter, clothings, and medication. Many died as a result of starvation and from waterborne diseases.\n\nClose to 8 million people became famine victims during the drought of 1984, and over 1 million died. In late 1985, another year of drought was forecasted, and by early 1986 the famine spread to parts of the southern highlands, with an estimated 5.8 million people being dependent on relief food. Exacerbating the problem in 1986 were locust plagues.\n\nThe primary Government response to the drought and famine was the decision to uproot large numbers of peasants who lived in the affected areas in the north and to resettle them in the southern part of the country. In 1985 and 1986, about 600,000 people were moved, many forcibly, from their home villages and farms by the military and transported to various regions in the south. Many peasants fled rather than allow themselves to be resettled; many of those who were resettled sought later to return to their native regions. Several human rights organizations claimed that tens of thousands of peasants died as a result of forced resettlement.\n\nAnother government plan involved villagization, which was a response not only to the famine, but also to the poor security situation. Beginning in 1985, peasants were forced to move their homesteads into planned villages, which were clustered around water, schools, medical services, and utility supply points to facilitate distribution of those services. Many peasants fled rather than acquiesce in relocation, which in general proved highly unpopular. Additionally, the government in most cases failed to provide the promised services. Instead of benefiting agricultural productivity, the program caused a decline in food production. Although temporarily suspended in 1986, villagization was subsequently resumed.\n\nIn 2003, more than 12 million people were at risk of famine, half of whom being children under 15 years of age. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of this crisis was that the famine persists despite generous outside food aid. Donations of wheat, soyabeans and oil can stave off much of the starvation in the short term, but they cannot keep hunger from returning year after year.\n\nDrought is the primary reason Ethiopians go hungry, but it intertwines with other factors that keep Ethiopians too poor and too sick to recover from drought years. Rural Ethiopians have never fully recovered from the famine of 1984, nor the severe droughts that have come after, especially in 1999 and 2000. The impact of drought in Ethiopia is magnified by the country\'s deforestation and the depletion of soil by farmers who cannot afford to let land lie fallow. The effects of dry periods linger long after the rains return.\n\nDrought reduces harvests and deprives livestock of water and pasture, forcing farmers and animal herders into a spiral of debt. Even if the rains are good, each year Ethiopians get hungrier. The long-term issue is poverty - famine hits those too destitute to buy food or produce their own. Fighting famine inside Ethiopia means providing not only emergency food, but also programs to help people emerge from the trap of destitution. Rural Ethiopians need more markets for their crops and better roads to be able to move their products to other parts of the country. Famine is not a sudden event, but an evolving process, one that involves much more than food.\n\nTraditionally the Economy of Ethiopia is based on subsistence agriculture... Due to a number of causes, the peasants did not have incentives to either improve production or to store their excess harvest. Despite the extensive modernization of Ethiopia in the last 120 years, as of 2005 the overwhelming majority of the populations are still peasants who live from harvest to harvest, and are vulnerable to crop failures. Table 1 summarizes the types of disasters, area (regions) affected, possible causes, and their effects in chronological order.\n\nTable 1 Chronology of major drought and famines in Ethiopia.\n\nDate Regions affected Causes and severity (description):\n\n1535 Tigray Famine and epidemic documented in Futuh, affecting Ahmad Gragn\'s occupying army\n\n1540 Not mentioned Contemporary accounts describe this famine as "worse than that which occurred at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple" (Pankhurst\n\n1567-1570 Harar Famine in combination with plague and Oromo incursions.

The drought affected 8.3 million people of the region. Heavy rainfall in April 2000 brought some relief, but the continuing conflict has restricted efforts to sort out the water supplies and sanitation in the region. The aid program includes the installation of water reservoirs and digging or repairing wells. Emergency repairs have been conducted by UNICEF, associated with the distribution of water treatment chemicals and jerry cans throughout the hardest hit areas. \'Donor fatigue\' and cynicism about the use of aid is a serious barrier to the international relief efforts to improve water supplies in the region.\n\nDrought is related to climate and is relatively slow to develop. The primary public consequence of drought in developing countries, where food can\'t be easily imported, is famine. In addition, drought and famine may cause extensive, long-lasting social tensions because they act to deepen poverty very suddenly and divide society between those who can afford to get food at any price and those who cannot. Drought and famine are also associated with large population movements that complicate the task of providing medical care, food, and water to the affected communities. Thus, the combination of drought and famine is one type of natural disaster related to climate that has many of the worst characteristics of technological disasters. In general drought is characterized by the following features:\n\n• A drought\'s onset and end are difficult to determine because the effects accumulate slowly and may linger even after the apparent termination of an episode;\n\n• The absence of precise and universally accepted definition adds to the confusion about whether a drought exists, and if it does, the degree of severity;\n\n• Drought effects are less obvious and spread over a larger geographic area.\n\nDisaster Preparedness for famine and drought\n\nSeveral preparedness activities will decrease the impact of droughts on human settlements. Establishment of a monitoring system is very important. The first step in drought preparedness is to establish a monitoring system to provide warning if a drought is imminent. A monitoring system should be based on simple information that nontechnical observers can easily acquire and transmit. Such a system is usually based on indicators. Among the normal indicators of the onset of drought are:\n\n• an unusual dry period;\n\n• an increased number of wind storms;\n\n• an increased number of dust storms;\n\n• diminishing water supplies;\n\n• an increase in the death rate of animals;\n\n• changes in the migratory patterns of nomads;\n\n• reduced price of animals;\n\n• changes in vegetation, especially the introduction of desert plants such as scrub brushes;\n\n• unusual changes in the prevalence rates of specific communicable diseases associated with personal and environmental hygiene, principally non-venereal skin diseases and diarrheal diseases, indicating the diminished use of water for washing.\n\nIdentify and stockpile seeds for alternative drought-resistant crops. Once drought begins, some attempts must be made to stimulate alternative agricultural activities. A number of crops can survive mild droughts.\n\nIdentify and stockpile feeds for cattle or other livestock. Losses can be greatly reduced if herds are penned up and fed in feedlots. This will save the animals, take pressure off the land, and let vegetation regenerate.\n\nDetermine human nutritional requirements and develop an on-site relief distribution plan.\n\nIdentify and select appropriate action to fight desertification. If desertification is a potential threat, measures should be taken to identify suitable approaches that could be employed to prevent the creation of deserts during a drought period.\n\n5.3. Floods\n\n• Flooding due to outburst of banks of Awash River, and over flow from Koka reservoir led to displacement of 40,000 people in Wonji and Metehara in1996.\n\n• Wabishebele river flooding affected 100,000 people in Somali region in 2003.\n\n• 260,000 were displaced and 170 died due to flooding from Wabe Shabelle, Hargeysa, Bilate, Ashewa, Genale, Dawa, Fafen, Sile and Sego rivers in months of April and June 2005.\n\n• The worst scenario of flood in Ethiopia occurred in the summer of 2006 as the result of prolonged and intensive rainfall which resulted in flash floods and overflow of rivers and dams affecting 199,900 people in eight regions of Ethiopia, resulting in loss of lives, damage of property, and destruction of livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. According to the government and humanitarian partner flash appeal of the year 2006 preliminary document, a total of 635 people have been died (364 in South Omo, 256 in Dire Dawa and 19 in other parts of the country).\n\nFigure 8 Flood vulnerable areas and population at risk as of August 24, 2006.\n\nThe distribution affected and vulnerable population by region is shown in table 2 below.\n\nTable 2 Distribution of Flood Vulnerable and Affected population of Ethiopia by administrative regions, September 2006\n\nThe effects and distribution of the 2006 floods are summarized as follows:\n\n• Dire Dawa: the heavy rains from the high lands of East Hararge zone of Oromia regional State caused flash flood from the overflow of Dechatu dry season stream that severely affected Dire Dawa in the middle of the night on the six of August 2006, while residents were asleep where by it killed 256 and affected 9,000 people. It also washed away houses and properties of many people living along the riverbank. Roads, bridges and other properties were damaged and washed away.

It also killed 364 people and took away some 3,200 cattle and destroyed other properties, including 760 trditional stores. Furthermore, flash floods from Bilate River was reported to have affected 5370 households, in Humbo district, of Wolayta zone of which 2,515 were severely affected and required immediate emergency assistance.\n\n• Amhara Region: overflow of Rib and Gomara Rivers and Lake Tana in Libo kemekem and Fogora districts of south Gondar, and Bahirdar town of west Gojam and flash floods in Dewchefa and Ansokia of Oromia and north -shewa zones respectively, displaced people from their residential places and forced about 13,362 people to stay under temporary shelters.\n\n• West Shewa Zone of Oromia Region: flooding of the upper basin of Awash River affected 14 peasant associations in Illu, Sebeta Awaso, and Ejere districts of the zone. The flood affected a total of 14,790 people out of which 2052 people were displaced and forced to live in temporary shelters.\n\n• Gambella Region: Overflow of Baro River affected crop fields of Gambella zuria, Jikawo, Itang, and Gillo distrcts.\n\n• Somali Region: overflow of Wabishebele Riveraffected 3,000 people from Mustahil and 4,500 people from Kelafo districts; also it destroyed 650 hectare of farmland.\n\n• Tigray Region: overflow of Tekeze Eiver in Kefta Humera of the Western Tigray zone displaced 450 households, destroyed houses and damaged crop fields.\n\nAccording to the preliminary document, the overall resource needed to withstand the disaster, both for emergency relief and rehabilitation was estimated to be US$ 60,907,574 (33).\n\n5.4. Earthquake:\n\nAt different times and in various places earthquakes have been noticed in Ethiopia.

Epidemics:\n\nEthiopia has been exposed to many epidemics of different magnitudes at different times in history. Among others, the following are worth mentioning\n\nMeningitis:\n\nThe country lies in the Meningitis belt of Africa where the epidemics of the disease occur in cyclical fashion. And, hence, Meningitis epidemics have hit the country in 1935, 1940, 1950, 1964, 1981 and 1989; with 50,000 cases and 990 deaths in1981; and 45,806 cases and 1686 deaths in 1989 and later as well including Addis Ababa in the year 2000-2001.\n\nMalaria:\n\nThree-fourth of Ethiopian land area is malarious and about 68 % of the population is at risk of infection; therefore, the country is repeatedly affected by different waves of epidemics. For instance, in 1958, 3 million people were affected, and 150,000 died. Currently, averages of 400,000-600,000 cases with positive blood film for malaria are treated annually. Additionally three to four times of this figure are clinically treated at community level without blood film examination. This condition is aggravated when compounded by other disasters due to migration to malarious areas, lowered immunity, changes in rain patterns, etc.\n\nCholera, Typhoid fever, Bloody Diarrhea, Louse-borne Relapsing fever, Measles and other communicable diseases are problems following other disasters due to low level of hygiene, shortage of potable water supply, overcrowding, pollution of water sources, malnutrition, etc. For example, occurrence of epidemics of suspected cholera was reported in the years: 1970, 1973 and 1985.\n\nHIV/AIDS is among the diseases that prevail during and following disasters due to social instability. Sexual exploitation is common when social bondage is loosened as the victims have less protection. Hopelessness and detachment from parents (families) subject people to unprotected and unsafe sexual behaviors.\n\nExercises:\n\n1.

Role of Primary Health Care Unit Team in the event of Disaster\n\nThe three main objectives of public health response to a disaster are to mitigate mortality and morbidity, restore the health status to pre-disaster levels, and establish a recovery process that will promote health and a preparedness level to even beyond the pre-disaster condition.\n\nPublic health professionals must take responsibility for community health in both disaster preparedness and response. The following are some of the roles of public health:\n\n• Identification of community resources applicable to the physical, social, and psychological effects of disaster;\n\n• Identification of groups most at risk of disaster (children, older adults; homeless, chronically ill, homebound, physically or mentally disabled);\n\n• Provision of disaster education both in advance of (i.e., what to expect in disaster) and after (i.e. how to deal with effects) event;\n\n• Taking responsibility for the health of community following a disaster;\n\n• Using such resources as assessment, epidemiology, and data analysis to make and implement recommendations for limiting morbidity and mortality following disaster;\n\n• Cooperation and collaboration with colleagues in the health sector to ensure that primary health, public health, mental health, and social impacts are adequately addressed in disaster planning;\n\n• Prevention of diseases by providing health advisories on injury prevention, food and water safety, and vector control;\n\n• Assuring that health services continue post impact including acute, continuity of care, primary care and emergency care;\n\n• Inspection of shelters and feeding operations;\n\n• Requesting volunteers from appropriate agencies like Red Cross to supplement medical and nursing needs;\n\n• Developing and advocating public policies designed to reduce the public health impact of potential disasters;\n\n• Communicating with government officials about the public health effects of potential disasters and providing expert assistances during and after disasters;\n\n• Collaborating with other health and human service professionals to rigorously evaluate the intervention outcome.\n\nThe responsibilities of public health agencies in disaster preparedness and response are more complicated than in a typical public health activity. In order to discharge the above duties and responsibilities the public health team should develop an action plan.\n\n6.2 Action plan\n\nThe health sector is responsible for ensuring the continuity of health care services. Components of the plan may include:\n\no Ensuring continuity of health care services (by checking the availability and functionality of all necessary resources);\n\no Monitoring environmental infrastructure (water, sanitation, and vector control);\n\no Assessing the needs of the elderly and other especial populations;\n\no Initiating injury prevention programs and surveillance;\n\no Ensuring that essential public health sector facilities will be able to function post-impact\n\no Allocating resources to ensure that the above responsibilities can be accomplished.\n\n6.3 Functional model of public health response\n\nThe functional model summarizes a typical disaster response within the public health field and categories the cycle of activities. The model identifies tasks assigned to each of the core areas of public health in the context of emergency management activities.\n\nThe functional model outlined below comprises of six phases that correspond to the type of activities involved in preparing for and responding to a disaster: planning, prevention, assessment, response, surveillance, and recovery. The model additionally delineates the responsibilities of various disciplines of public health.\n\n6.3.1 Planning:\n\n• Apply basic concepts of local public health (promotion, prevention, control, curative and rehabilitation activities)to disaster management;\n\n• Conduct health facilities disaster planning and coordinate with hospitals\n\n• Help community develop plan with public health focus;\n\n• Develop health promotion and disease prevention protocols and motivate use through education campaign;\n\n• Conduct needs assessments and analyze hazards and vulnerability;\n\n• Work with other health professionals to write a disaster plan specifically for public health and health concerns;\n\n• Train workforce on public health responsibilities;\n\n• Inventory supplies, equipment, communications, and people available for response;\n\n• Develop manual aid agreements in advance;\n\n• Conduct facility-wide/agency-wide exercises to stress organizational mobilization, coordination and communication.\n\n6.3.2 Prevention:\n\nPrimary prevention (before event):\n\n• Immunization;\n\n• Control/prevent outbreaks;\n\n• Protect against risks identified in hazards, vulnerability, and needs assessments;\n\n• Conduct community education in first aid, personal hygiene, and injury prevention;\n\n• Protect and distribute safe food and water;\n\n• Ensure availability and functionality (or reestablish) of sanitation systems.\n\nSecondary prevention (response to event):\n\n• Detect and extricate victims;\n\n• Provide emergency medical care;\n\n• Organize services and treatment;\n\n• Conduct case identification and surveillance;\n\n• Establish infectious disease control;\n\n• Conduct short-term counseling/intervention;\n\n• Manage bystanders\' response;\n\n• Burial of dead bodies.\n\nTertiary prevention (recovery from event):\n\n• Provide long-term counseling and mental health intervention;\n\n• Manage emergency services;\n\n• Manage injuries and clean-up behavior;\n\n• Reestablish health services;\n\n• Use records from response to update action plan\n\n6.3.3 Assessment:\n\n• Identify potential outbreaks;\n\n• Identify potential medical, behavioral, social, and political effects of events;\n\n• Assess potential effect loss of infrastructure on health and mental health;\n\n• Identify potential hazards and level of acceptable exposure;\n\n• Determine incidence of disease and causal factors;\n\n• Understand mechanics of hazardous agents (i.e. radiation, toxins, thermal and water pollution, landmines and weapons);\n\n• Determine vulnerability, level of risk and requirement for rapid needs assessment;\n\n• Identify appropriate data to collect for decision-making;\n\n• Summarize damage to health care infrastructure;\n\n• Establish continuous data monitoring.\n\n6.3.4 Response:\n\n• Conduct "quick and dirty" assessment on which to base initial decisions;\n\n• Administer logistics;\n\n• Organize services (usually management and behavioral health);\n\n• Communicate plans and needs (internal and external);\n\n• Identify need for and provide emergency treatment, resources and equipment;\n\n• Institute unified command and control;\n\n• Continue provision of primary care\n\n• Coordinate with emergency management response structures.\n\n6.3.4.1 Education:\n\n• How long foods can be stored in a refrigerator or freezer after the power goes off;\n\n• When the water is or is not safe to drink;\n\n• How long water should be boiled before drinking;\n\n• Whether mass immunizations are needed;\n\n• When it is safer to reenter homes or eat food after a toxic cloud is dissipated;\n\n• What is risk of delayed (long-term) effects (i.e. cancer, birth defects) from the chemical or nuclear mishap to the average citizen and to those who are pregnant?\n\n• How to protect from hazards.\n\n6.3.4.2 Management:\n\n• Dispose of waste, debris, human and animal bodies, and biologic hazards;\n\n• Control disease vectors;\n\n• Monitor water, sanitation, food, and shelter;\n\n• Control infection;\n\n• Control clean-up injuries (i.e. chainsaw accidents, electrocution, fire, unsafe structure);\n\n• Control delivery of mental health services;\n\n• Communicate health information and risks via media outlets;\n\n• Control diseases and issue quarantines where necessary;\n\n• Provide interventions into large groups.\n\n6.3.4.3 Surveillance:\n\n• Establish syndromic information systems for disaster;\n\n• Conduct sentinel surveillance, using active or passive systems, of disease and public health conditions;\n\n• Use data to recognize acute disease state and high risk groups.\n\n6.3.4.4 Recovery:\n\n• Determine present level and extent of patient care capability;\n\n• Interpret data to influence deployment of resources;\n\n• Work with community agencies to mitigate long-term impact of public health;\n\n• Conduct evaluations (structured, semi-structured, qualitative);\n\n• Plan and direct field studies;\n\n• Manage media;\n\n• Use principles of capacity building;\n\n• Mobilize resources;\n\n• Use techniques for supplemental and therapeutic food distribution and feeding;\n\n• Organize and conduct large-scale immunization and primary health care;\n\n• Ensure maintenance of mental health program;\n\n• Establish and operate special needs shelters.\n\nExercises:\n\nBriefly explain phases of the functional model that corresponds to type of activities involved in preparing for and responding to a disaster:\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Worldwide, 450 cities with populations over 1 million face recurring earthquakes. Cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes are among the deadliest and costliest of disasters. Droughts and desertification currently affect 250 million people and threaten 1.2 billion people in 110 countries (UNESCO, 2007). Annually recurring floods regularly prevent millions of children from attending a full year of school. </p><p>Education is a human right, universal and inalienable. Education is especially important in enabling people to reach their full potential and exercise other rights. This right does not disappear or get suspended because of disasters and emergencies. When education is interrupted or limited, students drop out, with negative and permanent economic and social impacts for students, their families, and their communities. Natural hazards are part of the context for educational planning. Whether it is annually recurring floods, a once-in-5-generations earthquake, the increasing severity of storms and cyclones, water shortages, or the slow onset of rising sea water levels, these known and expected hazards can be mitigated with the determined application of knowledge, education, and ingenuity. </p><p>We are not able to prevent the earth from shaking, the wind from blowing, or the rain from falling. However, with assessment and planning, physical and environmental protection and response preparedness we can prevent these events from becoming disasters. Since schools are our universal institution for sharing knowledge and skills, the expectations for schools to be role models in disaster prevention is high. Successful disaster mitigation is one of the ultimate tests of the success of the education we provide over generations. </p><p>This <i>Handbook </i>is written for administrators, teachers, support staff, and other individuals involved in emergency and disaster preparedness atschool. Its purposes are:\n</p><p>• To guide administrators and staff in assessing risks and planning and carrying out physical protection measures; </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• To develop skills and provisions for disaster and emergency preparedness, response, and rapid recovery;\n</p><p>• To support schools in developing disaster and emergency plans specific to their local needs and reflecting good practices internationally and nationally.\n</p><p>This handbook has been prepared with a primary focus on \'school safety\' and thus the language used throughout refers to \'schools\' versus \'universities\'. However, the underlying tenets in terms of the development of policy, planning and implementation is equally relevant regardless of the type of institution in question.\n</p><p> 3 </p><h2><p>School Disaster Management\n</p></h2><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b><i> School Disaster Management</i></b> is the process of assessment and planning, physical protection and response capacity development designed to: </p><p>1. Protect students and the staff from physical harm;\n</p><p>2. Minimize disruption and ensure the continuity of education for all children; 3. Develop and maintain a culture of safety.\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>School safety and educational continuity require a dynamic, continuous process ini-tiated by management and involving workers, students, parents, and the local com-munity. School disaster management involves the familiar cycle of steps found in all project management: <i>assess </i>hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities and resources; <i>plan and implement </i>for physical risk reduction, maintenance of safe facilities, standard operating procedures and training for disaster response; <i>test</i> mitigation and preparedness plans and skills regularly, with realistic simulation drills; and <i>revise</i> your plan based on your experience. </p><p>School disaster management mirrors individual and family disaster prevention, and wider community disaster prevention efforts. This guidance document is organized to help remember and observe the parallel processes for disaster prevention that are taken up at every level of society. The full scope of activities is included as follows:\n</p><p>1. <b>Assessment and planning </b>- establishing or empowering your school disaster management committee; assessing your risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities; making contingency plans for educational continuity; communicating your plan. 2. <b>Physical and environmental protection </b>- structural safety maintenance, nonstructural mitigation; local infrastructure and environmental mitigation; fire safety.\n</p><p>3. <b>Response capacity development </b>- standard operating procedures; response skills and organization; response provisions.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>4. <b>Practicing, monitoring, and improving </b>- holding simulation drills to practice, reflect upon and update your plan; monitoring indicators for school disaster management.\n</p><p>Comprehensive School Safety Schema\n</p><p>GOALS:\n</p><p>Student &amp; Staff Protection\n</p><p>Ob\n</p><p>ject\n</p><p>ive\n</p><p>s:\n</p><p>Ind\n</p><p>icat\n</p><p>ors\n</p><p>Educational Continuity\n</p><p>School Disaster Management\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>Culture of Safety\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>• Representative SDM Committee\n</p><p>• Assessment &amp; Planning\n</p><p>• Physical Protection\n</p><p>• Response Skills &amp; Provisions\n</p><p>• Educational Continuity Plan\n</p><p>• Policies &amp; Procedures\n</p><p>• Staff Development\n</p><p>Safe School Buildings\n</p><p>• Safe Site Selection\n</p><p>• Building Codes\n</p><p>• Performance Standards\n</p><p>• Disaster Resilient Design\n</p><p>• Builder Training\n</p><p>• Construction Supervision\n</p><p>• Quality Control\n</p><p>• Retrofit\n</p><p>• Remodeling\n</p><p>Disaster Prevention Education\n</p><p>• Extracurricular &amp; Community-based Informal Education\n</p><p>• Formal Curriculum Integration &amp; Infusion\n</p><p>• Teacher Training\n</p><p>• Building Maintenance\n</p><p> • Non-Structural Mitigation\n</p><p> • Fire Safety\n</p><p>• Structural\nSafety\nEducation\n</p><p>• Construction\nas Education\nOpportunity\n</p><p>• Family Disaster Plan\n</p><p>• Family Reunification\n</p><p>• School Drills\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p><b>1. Assessment and planning\n</b></p><p>Assessment and planning is the starting point for all thoughtful mitigation and safety efforts. For without assessment, planning is arbitrary and without planning, assessment has no purpose. The steps below can be accomplished in a matter of days.\n</p><p><b><i>Establish or empower your school disaster and emergency management committee\n</i></b></p><p>School safety is the job of the entire school community. This effort requires leadership and coordination by school administration, and involvement and participation from all sectors of the school community.\n</p><p>Each school should establish and maintain an ongoing School Disaster Management Committee (also called a School Safety Committee, or School Disaster and Emergency Management Committee) to oversee disaster risk reduction and preparedness. This may be the job of a pre-existing committee, sub-committee with a similar mission, or one newly established for this purpose. This committee develops, adapts, implements, and updates the school disaster management plan. It will typically meet intensively at the beginning of each school year and monthly during the school year. It will encourage personal and organizational preparedness, guide mitigation work, assure two fire and building evacuation drills annually, lead one full simulation drill annually, evaluate the results, and adjust the plan accordingly. Ideally, the committee is empowered by and maintains formal links between school and disaster management authorities. </p><p>School Disaster Management Committee members need strong leadership (ideally the school principal or assistant principal). The committee is most effective when it involves <i>representatives</i> of all major stakeholder groups, such as those listed below:\n</p><p>• School administration; </p><p>• Teachers - larger schools should make sure that all major departments or sections of school faculty and staff are represented;\n</p><p>• Staff - this includes facilities, maintenance, nutrition, security, health, counseling, transportation etc.\n</p><p>• Parents - this should be linked to the parent-teacher association or similar school welfare committee; </p><p>• School neighbors - this includes neighborhood civic association, large businesses, and public safety officials. It may be accomplished through communication and liaison where appropriate with police, fire services, emergency management authorities, neighborhood association, local business partners, school board, neighborhood elected officials and so on;\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• Vulnerable groups members - it may also be important to have an individual representing people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups whose needs might otherwise be overlooked;\n</p><p>• Students - ideally, this will be an elected representative from the student body.\n</p><p>Representatives are needed to facilitate two-way communication between all concerned groups, in the process of planning.\n</p><p>Members should remember that resilience is not accomplished all at once, but is a continuous process that can be broken down into small steps. Every small step is important in reaching the goals of safety and educational continuity. The committee might start by creating a calendar of activities to develop awareness and build momentum throughout the school year. Major milestones include:\n</p><p>• Form or re-form committee; </p><p>• Distribute Family Disaster Plan forms to staff, students and families; </p><p>• Complete School Hazard Impact Assessment;Identify vulnerabilities and capacities; </p><p>• Prioritize mitigation activities; </p><p>• Develop staff training plan; </p><p>• Review basic emergency and standard operating procedures;\n</p><p>• Conduct school and neighborhood hazard hunt; </p><p>• Check <i>School Evacuation Route Maps</i> posted in each classroom and corridor; </p><p>• Check fire suppression equipment; </p><p>• Identify campus and neighborhood risks, and resources on maps;\n</p><p>• Post neighborhood and school campus maps prominently; </p><p>• Check and re-supply administration, nursing office, and classroom <i>Go-Bags</i>; </p><p>• Request student comfort kits from families; </p><p>• Check and re-supply first aid kits and emergency supplies; </p><p>• Communicate student-family reunification procedures to parents; </p><p>• Update student emergency release permissions; </p><p>• Schedule fire drill and full simulation drills; </p><p>• Practice drills with each class; </p><p>• Minimum of two annual fire and building evacuation drills; </p><p>• Implement full simulation drill for other hazards. </p><p>• Evaluate drill and revise plans and procedures. </p><p>It is a good idea to have one large <i>school safety bulletin board</i> in a prominent location, which the committee can use to share information and to create and maintain disaster pre-\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>vention awareness in the school community. It is particularly important for the committee to remember that students of all ages <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> be involved, as much as possible and as appropriate, in all aspects of school disaster prevention. This learning experience will contribute to a culture of safety for future generations. Students can be involved as rotating classroom representatives, student government volunteers, scout volunteers, and through extra-curricular activities.\n</p><p>A School Disaster Plan is always a work-in-progress, and never a finished document. Successful plans emphasize planning as a process, rather than a neatly bound document. In the course of the steps below, you will generate and re-generate live documentation that will constitute your "plan." What is of crucial importance is having everyone participate in the planning, and learning and continuing to develop the plan through practice.\n</p><p><b><i>Assess risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities\n</i></b></p><p>Risks are assessed by considering potential hazards (whether these are natural, man-made, or combined), in relationship to a community\'s vulnerability characteristics (i.e., the circumstances that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard. Vulnerabilities apply to groups of people and to individuals, to the built environment and infrastructure, and to the natural environment. For example, young children, older adults, people with disabilities, poor people, minority language groups, recent immigrants, and illiterate people tend to be more vulnerable. Buildings not constructed to withstand hazards are vulnerable. Coastlines unprotected by coral reefs and mangrove forests are vulnerable to high winds. Marine life is vulnerable to oil spills, and so on.\n</p><p>The steps below will guide you to document the hazards you face, the vulnerability characteristics of people and places, and the resulting risks. Constructing your own risk matrix can help to see the larger picture, and focus and prioritize your efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and risks. This should be approached through research and dialogue. </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p><b>Assessing your hazards and risks\n</b></p><p>Using the <i>Risk Assessment Matrix</i> in the Addenda, work as a group to fill in the chart, taking these steps:\n</p><p>A. Identify all of the hazards that your school community may face. These may be of "natural" and/or "man-made" origin.\n</p><p>B. Discuss how likely these hazards are. In the case of earthquake, flood, volcano, landslide and similar, check with scientific and technical or disaster management authorities to be sure that you have an accurate understanding of these likelihoods. Some hazards are ever-present, some seasonal, some increase, and some are infrequent but inevitable. Rate the likelihood on a scale of 1 to 5. You should be planning for what may happen sometime during your school career, or your children and grandchildren\'s school years.\n</p><p>HAZARDS 1 2 3 4 5\n</p><p>Likelihood Very low Low Medium High Very high\n</p><p>C. Rate the impact severity for each of these hazards on a scale of 1 to 5. When rating impact severity, consider the wide range of losses that your school and community face, including these factors:\n</p><p>• <b>Human</b>-deaths, injuries, disability;\n</p><p>• <b>Physical</b>-damage to buildings, equipment, supplies;\n</p><p>• <b>Socia Cultural</b>-disruption and loss of friends, mentors, communities, cultural heritage;\n</p><p>• <b>Economic</b>-cost of repair and replacement, cost to students and families of delayed or incomplete education, loss of livelihoods in education;\n</p><p>• <b>Environmental</b>-loss of natural resources and habitats;\n</p><p>• <b>Psychosocial</b>-lost continuities, hopes and dreams;\n</p><p>• <b>Educational</b>-disrupted or degraded services, quality, outcomes.\n</p><p>Your community may be better prepared for some hazards than for others. As you reduce your vulnerabilities there will be less to worry about.\n</p><p>VULNERABILITIES 1 2 3 4 5\n</p><p>Impact severity Minor Controllable Critical Devastating Terminal\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>D.

Then, in Column E, convert your risk scores to simple priority scores: 3-low 2-medium 1-high.\n</p><p>RISK SCORE 1-3 8-4 14-9 19-15 25-20\n</p><p>PRIORITY LEVEL 3 3 2 1 1\n</p><p>Description Low Medium High\n</p><p><b>Assessing structural safety\n</b></p><p>Once you have prioritized the hazards that you will be addressing, then you will need to look further to assess structural and non-structural risks, and your resources for mitigation, response and recovery. The location, design and construction of a building can increase or decrease your school\'s vulnerability in the case of fire, earthquake, flood, landslide, snow or windstorm, extreme temperature, volcanic hazards, or bomb threats. </p><p>If you have identified these hazards as priorities, ideally you will already have taken structural safety measures in the course of school site selection and school construction, retrofit or remodeling. Note that for IFC projects, structural engineers and architects responsible for facilities, buildings, plants and structures should certify the applicability and appropriateness of the design criteria employed (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.81). </p><p>The <i>School Building Safety Checklist</i> in the Addenda will help you to identify any issues that would benefit from a closer look. This includes:\n</p><p>• Location and soil; </p><p>• Load carrying system;\n</p><p>• Building height;\n</p><p>• Design;\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• Construction detailing;\n</p><p>• Water damage.\n</p><p>Identify any structural safety concerns that may require further investigation. You may need the support of a qualified engineer or architect to undertake this assessment with you. If any of these conditions apply to your buildings, you will need to investigate further with professional engineering help. As warranted by engineering investigation, develop a strategy for mitigating structural deficiencies through retrofitting or during ongoing remodeling.\n</p><p><b>Assessing non-structural safety\n</b></p><p>If you have prioritized fire, earthquake, flood, and windstorms you will need to take a step further to assess non-structural risks associated with your buildings. This will help to identify those measures that can be taken to make classrooms, offices, and common spaces safer. The review team should include users of each space as well as facilities maintenance staff. Use your imagination and common sense as you go from room to room, and around the building.\n</p><p><b>Fire prevention and fire safety</b> measures are part of your initial school design, and also require regular maintenance and testing. Assess to be sure that: </p><p>• Flammable and hazardous materials sources are limited, isolated, eliminated, or secured. This includes electrical lines and appliances, heaters and stoves, natural gas pipes and LPG canisters, flammable or combustible liquids;\n</p><p>• Exit routes are clear to facilitate safe evacuation in case of fire or other emergency;\n</p><p>• Detection and alarm systems are working;\n</p><p>• Fire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n</p><p>• Other fire suppression and control equipment is regularly tested and maintained;\n</p><p>• Mechanical, electrical, and civil structures and systems are maintained and operable, in compliance with life and fire safety design criteria (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.80).\n</p><p>For <b>cyclone/high winds safety</b> think about objects that can be torn away, fly away or be battered by wind outside. Note what can be done, and who should do it. </p><p>For <b>earthquake safety</b> think about objects that may slide, fall, or fly, and especially anything that can cause injury or block exits. Note what can be done, who should do it, and when it should be completed. </p><p>Prioritize the items as follows:\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• Priority 1: <b>secure items that can kill or injure or block exits </b>(e.g., heavy equipment, heating/cooling units, pipes, storage tanks, overhead lighting, bookshelves, hazardous chemicals, things blocking exits). Note that <i>all </i>exit doors should open outwards.\n</p><p>• Priority 2: <b>secure things can cause significant economic or cultural loss, cause injury, or impair educational continuity </b>(e.g., computers, audio-visual equipment, school awards, and breakables).\n</p><p>• Priority 3: <b>secure things that, if damaged, can impede recovery.</b> </p><p><b>Assessing capacities and resources for mitigation, response and recovery\n</b></p><p>Your school community also has many strengths, capacities and resources that need to be identified and mobilized. As you read through this guide you will develop a good grasp of some of the physical protection measures, as well as response and recovery skills and resources that you will need. Make a list of all of these needs. Then, in your school community, identify the people and places with the knowledge, skills, and provisions you need, and find out how you can activate that capacity to reduce your risks and speed your recovery. Identify resources and problem-solve to fill the gaps. Include name, skills/resources, location and contact information. </p><p>In terms of knowledge and skills for risk reduction, think about: structural engineers, environmental engineers, safety experts, facilities staff, handymen, plumbers, electricians, builders. For response and recovery, think about: emergency management experts, health professionals, volunteer groups, scouts, women, organizing volunteers, obtaining supplies, communication experts, shelter construction, and supplies management. Find out what response skills your staff and students already have. Use this assessment to plan for needed training to fill the gaps.\n</p><p>Finally, consider the provisions you will need for response and recovery. As a rule of thumb, collectively as a community you should plan to be able to take care of yourselves for seven days. Between home, school, and work everyone will need four liters of water per person/per day, high energy food. As a school community you will be expected to provide leadership in this. Planning for shelter and sanitation and a site for stockpiling communal supplies are all reasonable expectations from schools.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b><i> Creative problem solving to bridge the gap between needs and resources</i></b>: in one university, a single supplier delivers drinking water to many buildings and departments, but none had extra supplies.

Review and revise these maps as you develop and revise your disaster prevention plan. </p><p><b><i>Contingency planning for educational continuity </i></b></p><p>When students are out-of-school for any prolonged period of time, drop-out rates increase, resulting in lifelong negative impacts. Staff unemployment also follows. In addition to all of the steps taken for hazard and resource assessment, physical protection, and response capacity development, you will also need to have contingency plans for how to continue providing education to students as quickly as possible following hazard impact. This is especially true for schools that face recurring hazards such as annual floods. Alternate sites, temporary shelters, delivery of homework packets, radio and television delivery of lessons are just some of the creative alternatives for making sure that education continues. In the post-disaster period, students will also need to participate in recovery efforts, and have time set aside for a variety of psychosocial support activities, and opportunities for communal grief recovery, to ease their adjustment to the sudden losses in their lives. This may include people, homes, jobs, communities and tangible cultural heritage.\n</p><p>Your school, if in good condition, may also be called upon to be used as an emergency shelter, further disrupting education. If you use private services for security, catering and transportation, these companies should be included in your planning process. Have memoranda of understanding ahead of time with engineers who can inspect your building for safety, water pumping equipment providers, and various other contingency steps can be taken in advance and speed your recovery.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p><b><i>Communicating your plan\n</i></b></p><p>School faculty and staff, students, parents, and local community leaders and first responders all need to be familiar with your plans, in order for them to work effectively. Community members have a great deal to offer the school disaster management process, supporting in risk reduction activities, participating in school drills, volunteering during response and recovery, and providing response supplies.\n</p><p>You may want to hold special meetings with local public safety representatives, and an open meeting for your entire school community to communicate your plans and invite participation and support. Communicate this information in as many ways as possible (written, audio, visual, demonstration, and through younger students). Translate as necessary to include everyone. </p><p>Staff need to understand your expectations of them. If a disaster occurs, when are they expected to report to work? How they will organize shifts? Which individuals may not be able to stay because young children or elderly family members are at home. Open discussion and realistic planning will help. Everyone will want to know what notification systems you will be using (telephone tree, posted notice on building, radio, automated phone messages, e-mail, school web-page). </p><p>Parents need to be knowledgeable and involved. It is essential for disaster preparedness that parents know and trust that their children will be safe and cared for at school, until the danger has passed or outside help arrives, even for two to three days! Let them know, <i>in advance,</i> all emergency procedures. </p><p>Clearly explain student release procedures to parents, students and community members. Students will be released only to parent/guardian or other pre-authorized emergency contact (who should bring photo identification with them). Provide information about alternate evacuation and reunification site, especially if your school grounds are not likely to be safe because of nearby hazards. Explain that in case of a lockdown, the school will not be able to answer incoming phone calls or make outside calls. Police will provide assistance. No one, including parents, will be allowed near the school. Students will be kept inside and not permitted to leave until the lockdown is lifted by the police. After that, parents may come to school to pick up their children.\n</p><p>As part of this communication process, you should ask parents to provide:<i> </i></p><p>• <i>Emergency contact information: </i>in order to implement student release procedures, be sure that parent and emergency contact information is updated at the beginning of each school year and that parents notify the school of changes during the school year. </p><p>• <i>Student comfort bags:</i> these hold essential supplies each child in case of emergency (see Section 3.C below).\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>And last but not least, students will be empowered participants in disaster prevention, now and in the future, if they are fully and thoughtfully included in communicating school safety plans.\n</p><p><b>2. Physical and environmental protection\n</b></p><p>Your plan to reduce vulnerability and risks will need to consider:\n</p><p>• <b><i>Structural safety</i></b> - this addresses the safety of buildings on or near the school site;\n</p><p>• <b><i>Non-structural safety</i></b> - this addresses the threats posed by building furnishings and equipment as well as building elements such as roofs, windows, stairs, heating and cooling systems, water storage, pipes, and exit routes. This includes fire safety;\n</p><p>• <b><i>Local infrastructure</i></b> - this addresses lifeline utilities such as water, electricity, gas, as well as communications and transportation conduits. It also covers transportation safety;\n</p><p>• <b><i>Environmental mitigation </i></b>- this addresses ambient conditions such as temperature, inundation, hazardous materials release, and climate change impacts.\n</p><p>The dos and don\'ts below will assist in identifying and implementing these protection measures. </p><p><b><i>Structural safety maintenance\n</i></b></p><p>While implementation of structural safety measures is beyond the scope of this document, building maintenance is a critical component in the maintenance of structural and nonstructural safety. Damage should be repaired as discovered, and structural safety should not be compromised through alteration and misuse. Responsibility for this rests with local school administration and designated facilities and maintenance personnel.\n</p><p>Check to be sure that you:\n</p><p>• Do not compromise columns or beams by cutting, exposing, or making holes in them; </p><p>• Do not let reinforcing steel be exposed to air or moisture; </p><p>• Do cover exposed steel with concrete mortar; </p><p>• Fix wood rot, cracked mortar, cracked bricks, and concrete damage; </p><p>• Keep gutters and drainage systems clear of debris;\n</p><p>• Make sure that water and moisture drains away from building; </p><p>• Replace broken glass.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p><b><i>Non-structural safety\n</i></b></p><p>Non-structural safety measures are those that are not connected with the weight-bearing system of the building, and those that are in the hands of users. This includes fire prevention and readily available fire suppression equipment. Special attention is required to make sure that all building occupants can safely exit in case building evacuation is necessary. In case of earthquake and storms, the main considerations are injury prevention both within and immediately outside buildings.\n</p><p>Do check that: </p><p>• All classroom doors, doors of high-occupancy rooms, and doors to outside open outwards;\n</p><p>• Exit pathways are kept clear;\n</p><p>• Non-structural building elements are securely fastened to the building to resist wind or earthquake </p><p>• shaking; </p><p>• Fire suppression equipment is located appropriately and maintained in good working condition;\n</p><p>• Flammable and combustible materials are limited, isolated, eliminated, and separated, away from • dangerous interactions and heat sources;\n</p><p>• Electrical systems are maintained and are not overloaded; </p><p>• Classrooms have two exits wherever possible. (Sometimes the second exit is a window.)\n</p><p>If you face earthquakes and windstorms:\n</p><p>• Move heavy items below head level;\n</p><p>• Tightly secure tall and heavy furniture and appliance to walls, floors and ceilings. (e.g., use L-brackets to walls or spring-loaded adjustable tension rods to ceiling or wedges under bottom front, or strip barrier fastened to tabletop, as appropriate);\n</p><p>• Fasten cabinet doors and drawers with latches that will hold shut during shaking; Secure heaters and cooling systems suspended inside or outside of building; </p><p>• Fasten liquid propane gas tanks, fire extinguishers and other gas cylinders to the wall;\n</p><p>• Protect from glass that may break into large shards (e.g., rearrange furniture, use window film, curtains, or install strengthened glass.);\n</p><p>• Secure heavy and important electronic items to table top or floor using straps and </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• Secure lighting fixtures to ceiling;\n</p><p>• Fasten pictures on closed hooks; </p><p>• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials.\n</p><p>And for floods:\n</p><p>• Raise important items above possible flood level;\n</p><p>• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials above flood level.\n</p><p><b><i>Local infrastructure safety\n</i></b></p><p>Local infrastructure includes the water, electricity, gas, heating and cooling systems, communications and transportation systems in your area. These are usually part of larger systems maintained by government and private agencies. Careful design and problem-solving with these organizations, ahead of time, can protect students and educational assets, and make these systems resilient. Depending on the hazards faced, a wide variety of solutions can be considered:\n</p><p>• Relocate overhead wires and poles that may block exit routes;\n</p><p>• Install automatic natural gas shut off valves at building level;\n</p><p>• Use flexible connectors for pipes;\n</p><p>• Consider dangers posed by overhead and underground pipes and depots;\n</p><p>• Replace radioactive lightening rods with those that do not pose health risk.\n</p><p>Transportation safety may involve road and pedestrian crossing conditions as well as operations of school or contractor buses or minivans. On an annual basis, worldwide, transportation accidents are the leading cause of student deaths and injuries. Clear lines of sight and signage, stop signs, traffic lights, clearly marked pedestrian crosswalks, and crossing-guards at busy crossings are all important safety measures. Vehicle safety, driver testing and training, and installation, maintenance, and use of seat belts, and careful routing are all of importance in ensuring that students are safe in school transport. Once on school transportation, rules of access and conduct, and adult supervision are also important factors. </p><p><b><i>Environmental safety\n</i></b></p><p>Environmental safety issues bring schools into focus in their local environments. Thinking through all of the conditions that you face, what are some of the environmental safety issues to explore to increase your own safety? </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>There are other ways that your school community can be involved in environmental protection and climate change mitigation-through "green school" measures and through community activities such as environmental clean-up, anti-litter signage, awareness campaigns and similar activities to encourage citizens to reduce, re-use and recycle.\n</p><p><b>3. Response capacity development\n</b></p><p>The final piece of the puzzle involves the development of response capacity. This includes the systematic organization of response, standard response skills (including basic emergency procedures and procedures for specific hazards), and accessing provisions during an emergency. <b>Details on each follows.\n</b></p><p><b><i>Response organization using Incident Command Systems (ICS) </i></b></p><p>Response capacity involves knowledge, procedures, skills, and provisions. The most important aspect of response capacity is organization and mobilization of existing skills and resources. A standard emergency management system, such as<i> Incident Command Systems (ICS) </i>shown in the diagram at the bottom of this section, can be used as a guiding framework for coordinating the many standard functions that may be called for in different emergency situations.\n</p><p><b>Incident command systems </b></p><p>The purpose of ICS is to ensure that the <i>most help</i> reaches the <i>most people</i>, and to provide a consistent system that staff, students, and emergency personnel can apply in any school, anywhere. Key principles are:\n</p><p><b>Conditions Solutions to explore\n</b></p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Extreme weather during school year </p></td><td><p>school design, alternate locations, alternate delivery methods\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Landslide tree-planting, slope stabilization, retaining wall, evacuation routes\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Forest fires </p></td><td><p>fire breaks\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Tsunami evacuation routes, stairs, ladder\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Drought / Food insecurity </p></td><td><p>rainwater harvesting, school gardens, tree planting, food storage\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Solid waste management recycling point\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Water and energy shortage and costs </p></td><td><p>water and energy conservation\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hazardous materials production or storage\n</p><p>community "right-to-know", regular review of safety measures, facility tours and dialogues\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Air pollution </p></td><td><p>walking and bicycling to school, car-pooling\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• Standardization - the use of common terminology (and no codes);\n</p><p>• Unified chain of command in order to assign resources for maximum effectiveness;\n</p><p>• Flexible, modular organization, mobilized as needed; and\n</p><p>• Integrated communications.\n</p><p>There are five key functions in ICS are that can be mobilized as needed in the particular circumstances. These five functions form a common approach to organize response to any emergency or disaster. Depending on the number of staff and trusted volunteers or capable older-students available, some people may need to have multiple roles.\n</p><p>• <b>Incident command: </b>these are<b> decision-makers </b>(responsible for/set mission)\n Although someone in your school may be designated as <b>"</b>Emergency Manager<b>"</b> under normal circumstances, in case of actual disaster or emergency, the <b>"</b>Incident Commander<b>"</b> is the first capable person on the scene, until that function can be transferred to a more qualified person or higher authority. Even if normally that person is a Principal or Assitant Principal, several different people should practice in this role, as those indiviuals may or may not be available during an actual emergency or disaster. The <b>"</b>Incident Commander<b>"</b> mobilizes the on-site "Incident Command Center.<b>"\n</b></p><p>• <b>Communications team: </b>these are<b> communicators </b>(listeners and talkers)\n</p><p>  The communications team is the right arm of the Incident Commander, establishing connections with education administration, public safety, and emergency management authorities, and with parents and the public, as directed. When communications systems are operational some information can be disseminated using telephone trees, and radio announcements. In large-scale disasters the key communications are with students (often by the school principal or assistant principal, using a megaphone to communicate) and with parents anticipating reunification with students. </p><p>• <b>Operations branch: </b>these are<b> doers </b>(carry out the mission)<b> </b></p><p>  This branch requires a highly organized and well-respected Operations Chief, who manages teams to fulfill: light search and rescue, fire suppression and hazardous materials control, utility shut-off, disaster first aid, psychosocial support, security, and student release/family reunification functions.\n</p><p>• <b>Logistics branch</b>: these are<b> getters/supporters </b>(support the mission) </p><p>  This branch requires a Logistics Chief, who knows the site and its resources best. These teams will find and distribute supplies and provisions, shelter and sanitation, water and nutrition, and organize volunteer recruitment and assignment.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• <b>Information and planning: </b>these are<b> documenters and analyzers </b>(support the mission) </p><p>  This branch is typically mobilized in advance of a disaster, identifying and researching resources, executing memoranda of understanding in advance. During an incident it documents the situation, activities, and assures accurate record keeping.\n</p><p>• <b>Finance/administrators: </b>these are<b> payers </b>(pay and negotiate)<b> </b></p><p>  This function typically keeps records of resources and staff time expended during any emergency, arranging compensation where permitted, and negotiating as needed for access to needed resources.\n</p><p>ICS is a flexible system that can be activated to different levels, depending on the situation. For example, an intruder on campus, a fight between students, or traffic accident might be handled by activating Level I alone. A small fire or flood might require Level II activation. A major disaster, such as an earthquake might require full activation of multiple teams at Level III. Maintaining this structure allows more responders to be integrated, maintaining the chain of command, and a manageable span of control (i.e., 5-8 people per supervisor). It is <i>not</i> normally recommended to have permanent teams with single functions because each situation differs, and may call for more or fewer people on any particular team. As much as resources permit, staff should cross-train. Even if response teams are formed ahead of time, staff should understand and be prepared to assume any response role, as needed. Incident Command Systems are designed to be flexible, and to activate from the top down, only to the level, and only those functions required by the particular disaster or emergency. </p><p><b><i>Standard operating procedures\n</i></b></p><p>Standard emergency response procedures depend on the hazard, and can and should be customized to your unique circumstances. These are built around six basic emergency procedures detailed below:\n</p><p>• Building evacuation;\n</p><p>• Shelter-in-place;\n</p><p>• Lockdown;\n</p><p>• Assemble and shelter outside;\n</p><p>• Evacuate to safe haven;\n</p><p>• Emergency student release/family reunification.\n</p><p>Each of the procedures is described in detail below. Remember that individuals with disabilities, foreign language speakers and visitors unfamiliar with these procedures may </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>need assistance in following them. The<i> Emergency Procedures Decision-Tree</i> that follows illustrates the different circumstances that lead to these six basic procedures. </p><p><b>Question #1</b>-<b>Is there any warning before the hazard impact?</b> Is the hazard rapid-onset, without warning (such as acts of violence, earthquake, fire), or is it a slow or medium-onset hazard with some early warning (such as floods, cyclone, winter storms, etc.)? In the case of medium onset events with early warning, school maybe closed, and alternate education </p><p>Incident Command Systems Organigram\n</p><p>School Safety/School Disaster &amp; Emergency Management Committee\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Safety Officer\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Operations\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Damage Assessment Light Search &amp; Rescue\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fire Suppression\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>First Aid\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Psychosocial Support\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Student Supervision\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Student Release\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Equipment &amp; Supplies\n</p><p>Volunteering &amp; Staffing\n</p><p>Transportation &amp; Traffic\n</p><p>Shelter &amp; Sanitation\n</p><p>Water &amp; Food\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>Planning, Analysis\n</p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><p>&amp; Finance\n</p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><p>Documentation\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Procurement\n</p><p>Logistics\n</p><p>Administration, Finance &amp; Documentation\n</p><p>Management/ Commander\n</p><p>Communications Team\n</p><p>Liaison Officer\n</p><p>Public Information Officer\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Level I\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Level II\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Level III\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>delivery methods set into motion. In this case, normal student-release procedures would be applied. In some situations, schools may be the shelter-of-choice for the local community. In the case of violence (person with weapon, terrorist activity) administration should announce a lockdown<b>. </b></p><p><b>Question #2</b>-<b>Is the building safe?</b> The second question is whether the building is safe. If the building is unsafe then <b><i>building evacuation</i></b> should be immediately triggered. In the case of rapid onset hazards such as fire and earthquake, the building must be assumed to be unsafe, and therefore cautious building evacuation should be automatically triggered. (Note that during earthquake shaking, everyone should<i> "drop, cover and hold on</i>" and that evacuation should only begin once the shaking has stopped.) In other situations a rapid assessment can be made before evacuation. If the building is safe then the students and staff should be instructed to <b><i>shelter-in-place</i></b>. <i>Reverse evacuation</i> is practiced for orderly return from assembly area back into classrooms, to shelter-in-place.\n</p><p><b>Question #3</b>-<b>Are the school grounds are safe?</b> If school grounds are safe then <b><i>assemble and shelter outside</i></b> is the procedure. If school grounds are known to be unsafe (e.g., in coastal area with tsunami risk) then automatic <b><i>evacuation to safe haven</i></b> should take place. A rapid assessment (e.g., of hazardous materials, fallen power lines, pipeline ruptures) will help decide between these two options.\n</p><p>In all cases, following assembly, reassessment should take place periodically and one of these actions maintained. In the case of real disasters and emergencies incidents, <b><i>emergency student release</i></b> procedures should be initiated, ensuring that students are returned directly and only to the care of parents/guardians or their pre-designated emergency contacts, and each reunion documented. Students should remain cared for and supervised until the last student is reunited and the <i>All Clear</i> is given by the incident commander (explained in the next section). In the case of drills and small events a <i>reverse evacuation </i>may be practiced to return to class, prior to<i> </i>"<i>All Clear</i>" instruction and resumption of classes. </p><p><b>Building evacuation, evacuation to safe haven and assembly procedure\n</b></p><p><b>Administration:</b> sounds fire alarm; makes announcement to students and staff. In case of fire, close doors and windows. In case of hazardous materials, close ventilation system. Activate Incident Command System as appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Maintain communication. Announce any new procedure. Announce "<i>All Clear</i>" when emergency has ended.\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p><b>Staff: </b><i>ahead of time, p</i>ractice as a class, following both fire and earthquake procedures. Identify any students or staff who may need special assistance during evacuation. Learn from these individuals how best to help them. Teach students how to provide assistance ahead of time. In schools with large numbers of disabled students needing assistance, volunteers should be recruited from the immediate vicinity and trained. Be prepared to help visitors as well.\n</p><p><i>At time of alarm or after earthquake shaking stops:</i> </p><p>1. Remind students to follow instructions for building evacuation: "Don\'t Talk. Don\'t Push. Don\'t Run. Don\'t Turn Back." Students should exit with buddies in twos. Check that students or staff needing special assistance have it. Remind students <i>NOT</i> to use cell phones, to keep lines free for emergency communications! </p><p>2. Take your:\n</p><p>• Classroom <i>Go-Bag or Go-Bucket;\n</i></p><p>• <i>Emergency clipboard or notebook</i> with class lists and <i>Class Status Report Forms (See Addenda);\n</i></p><p>• Duffle bag packed with <i>student comfort bags. </i></p><p>3. Use the buddy system. Take a few seconds to check briefly with the teacher in the classroom to the left, to the right, and across the hall to see if they are in need. Unless instructed otherwise, evacuate using normal building evacuation routes posted. If you encounter obstructions, such as jammed door, be prepared to take an alternate route. One teacher should be in the front to check that the evacuation route is clear. One responsible student monitor should be immediately behind the teacher, keeping students quiet and orderly. One teacher and responsible student monitor should be at the rear of the group, seeing that everyone is together. Move directly away from the building when exiting. Designated teachers from each wing should check washrooms as they exit.\n</p><p>4. Take your seat in the emergency assembly area (normally, organized by first period or homeroom class). Keep classes separate and take roll. Check again for injuries. If any students are injured, send them with two buddies to the First Aid station, with instructions to return together immediately. For large schools, mount your classroom identification sign at front of group above head level. Fill out your <i>Classroom Status Report Form</i> and return it to Incident Command Center with student runner.\n</p><p>5. Remind students about student-release procedures and their purpose to keep them safe. Remind them <i>not</i> to use their cell phones in order to keep lines open for emergency. For emergency communication, use SMS only. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class). </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>6. If you are a member of the Search and Rescue, First Aid Team or Fire Suppression Team, have the teacher next to you supervise your class and proceed to the Incident Command Center. </p><p>7. Teachers are to remain with their class <b>AT ALL TIMES</b>. <b>Students must remain seated together as a class.</b> Periodically call roll as needed. Keep students quiet so that they can hear information from the public address or megaphone/bullhorn system that will be used for announcements. Children are to leave only in the company of reunion gate messengers. The Incident Command Center will provide updates and relieve staff of their assignments.\n</p><p>Note: all personnel without a specific duty or class are to immediately report to the Incident Command Center for instructions. All teaching assistants and campus aides who do not have a class are to report immediately to the assembly area to assist with the supervision of students. </p><p><b>Evacuation to safe haven:</b> all schools should designate an alternate site for assembly should school grounds need to be evacuated. Identify evacuation routes ahead of time, and inform parents of this alternate site. Schools that face known risks such as flooding, landslide, debris flow, tsunami, chemical release, or schools that do not have a safe assembly area on-site, should arrange and prepare safe havens ahead of time with emergency supplies. If necessary, also arrange transportation to your safe haven depending on the threats you face, evacuation to safe haven may be automatic (e.g., following earthquake in coastal areas with tsunami threat), or you may wait for evaluation by on-site incident commander and assessment team. </p><p><b>Reverse evacuation:</b> there may also be times when it becomes necessary to <i>go back inside</i>, because <i>inside</i> is safer than outside. Practice <i>reverse evacuation </i>at the end of your drills, when you go back to your classrooms, following all of the same rules.\n</p><p><b>N.B. Always assume and act as though an alarm is signaling a real threat.</b><i> </i>Whether an alarm is a real situation, a drill, or even a false alarm, safety demands that you practice your response procedures as though it were real event!\n</p><p><b>Shelter in place procedure\n</b></p><p>You may be requested to shelter-in-place when there are dangers outside the school that prevent normal student release, such as severe weather or flooding, nuclear, biological or chemical incident or terrorist attack. Shelter-in-place is appropriate when evacuation is not </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>necessary, or when there is not time to evacuate. It should be announced throughout the school using a public address system or face-to-face communication.\n</p><p><b>Administration:</b> 1.<b> </b>Activates Incident Command System as needed. 2. Announces to students and staff to stay in, or return to indoor shelter areas. Close all doors and windows, if appropriate. Turn off ventilation system, if appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Announce "<i>All Clear</i>"<i> </i>when the emergency has ended. </p><p><b>Staff:\n</b></p><p>1. Clear the halls of students and staff immediately and report to nearest available classroom or pre-designated shelter locations inside the facility.\n</p><p>2. Teachers keep your emergency go-bag or bucket and notebook or clipboard with you.\n</p><p>3. Assist those with special needs.\n</p><p>4. Close all windows and doors and lock entrances, if appropriate.\n</p><p>5. Seal the room from outside air infiltration, shutting off heating, ventilating or cooling system, if appropriate.\n</p><p>6. Take attendance and turn in <i>Class Status Report Form</i> to Incident Commander when safe to do so.\n</p><p>7. Turn on radio/TV and monitor for further information or instruction.\n</p><p>8. Have students leave their cell phones on their desks. In generalized disasters it is important to keep lines open for emergency. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class). </p><p>9. Stay where you are until instructed otherwise by school authorities. 10. Create a schedule for learning, recreation, eating and sleeping.\n</p><p><b>Lockdown procedure\n</b></p><p>Lockdowns are called for when there is a violent intruder or person with weapon, if a threat of violence or other crisis occurs inside or outside the school and if moving around or evacuation would be dangerous. A distinct loud siren or alarm should be used to signal immediate lockdown. </p><p><b>Administration: </b>sound lockdown signal and announce: "Attention-There is an intruder in the building. Initiate lockdown procedure." <i>Do NOT activate fire alarm!</i> Take cover. Activate Incident Command and prepare to transfer command to police or public safety authorities. Monitor situation. Reassess and provide updates and instructions as available.

Gather students into classrooms, maintaining calm. Try to warn other faculty, staff, students and visitors to take immediate shelter. If you are outside the building proceed immediately to a secure area, away from the threat. </p><p>2. Close and lock the doors from inside. Stay out of sight and stay away from doors and windows. Wherever you are, turn all available desks and/or tables onto their sides facing the hallway and/or outside windows, if necessary.\n</p><p>3. Instruct students to drop and cover behind the desks making themselves as small a target as possible. Do <i>not</i> close coverings on outside windows. </p><p>4. Turn off lights and turn off radios and other devices that emit sound. Silence cell phones.\n</p><p>5. Stay where you are until instructed in person by police or school authorities.\n</p><p>6. Follow instructions to continue class and/or use Disaster and Emergency Student Release procedures. </p><p><b>Emergency student release procedure\n</b></p><p>Disaster and emergency student release procedures are intended to ensure that students and families are safely reunited, following any unsafe or unusual circumstances. In the event of an emergency or disaster, students under the age of 16 should not be permitted to leave school except in the company of an adult approved by parent or guardian.\n</p><p><b>Parents: </b>provide and maintain an updated <i>List of Emergency Contacts </i>for their child. This should include parents or guardians and two or three trusted relatives or friends nearby who will be nearby or come to collect student in case of emergency. In the event of emergency or disaster, the student will only be released to persons on this list or authorized by persons on this list.\n</p><p><b>Administration: </b>ensures that <i>List of Emergency Contacts</i> for each student is updated by parents at the beginning of the school year, and can be updated by parents at any time. Maintains the current copy of student emergency contacts in administration office "Go-Box", and annually in the school emergency supplies bin.\n</p><p><b>Teachers: </b>make sure that both students and parents are familiar with student release procedures for emergencies and disasters.\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p><b>Reunification Team: </b>greets parents and emergency contacts at request gate, providing them with <i>Student-Family Reunification Form (permit to release child)</i> form to fill out. Verify that the adult picking up the child is listed on the <i>List of Emergency Contacts</i> and verify their identity. Reunites students at reunification gate. Keeps signed copies of <i>Student-Family Reunification Forms </i>in order to respond to any query.<b> </b>Organizes <i>request</i> and <i>reunification</i> functions for maximum efficiency and safety. </p><p><b>Hazard specific response procedures\n</b></p><p><b>General:\n</b></p><p><b><i>Visitor registration</i></b>: to protect visitors from all hazards, and to protect students and staff from intruders, schools must maintain a single entrance and registration system with nametags for visitors, so that staff and students will know that unfamiliar people have identified themselves before moving around on campus. Communicate these rules widely and assist visitors in the registration process. </p><p><b><i>Emergency calls:</i></b><b> </b>when calling for police, ambulance, fire or other emergency services be prepared to describe WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHAT is happening, WHO you are and how to call you back. Do not hang up until told to do so. For personal safety you should program a next-of-kin phone number under the name "ICE" in your cell phone. This is the universal name for "In Case of Emergency". </p><p><b><i>Medical emergency:</i></b><b> </b>provide immediate medical care and call ambulance if necessary.\n</p><p><b>Threats of Violence: </b>violent incidents at school are not impulsive, random, or epidemic. Prior to most incidents the attacker told someone about his/her idea or plans. There is no accurate profile of a violent offender. Some, but not all violent students have social difficulties, and there are many motivations for violence. Prevention can be achieved by building a climate of trust and respect between students and adults. School should provide a place for open discussion where diversity and differences are allowed and communication is encouraged and supported. Attention must be paid to students\' social and emotional as well as academic needs. </p><p>Whenever any threat is made, <i>do not</i> ignore them, and do not over-react. Threats of violence may be: <i>direct</i>- specific act against a specific target identified in a clear and explicit manner; <i>indirect</i>-<i>v</i>ague, unclear, ambiguous or implied violence; <i>veiled</i>-implied but not explicitly a threat; <i>conditional</i>-warning of violence, if terms are not met (e.g., extortion). A professionally-trained threat assessment team may need to evaluate whether the threat </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>poses low, medium or high risk, considering student behavior, personality, school, social, and family dynamics. </p><p>• <b><i>If there is a suspicious or unknown persons</i></b>. If you sense a threat, ask a colleague for immediate help. If you feel threatened trust your feelings. Keep distance. Use assertive verbal language and strong body language. Call police as necessary. Call for immediate <i>lockdown</i> if necessary. </p><p>• <b><i>If you encounter bullying.</i></b> School culture should not tolerate bullying and anyone witnessing or experiencing bullying should feel comfortable reporting it and knowing that adults will follow up. Supportive family intervention may be needed for both victims and perpetrators of bullying. For more information see <i>http:// www.stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/kids/\n</i></p><p>• <b><i>If there is a fight among students.</i></b><b> </b>Call or send someone to the office. You are <i>not </i>required to physically intervene.<b> </b>Identify yourself and instruct combatants to stop.<b> </b>Call them by name, instruct spectators to move away.<b> </b>Keep track of events for subsequent report.<b> </b>Dispatch staff to control and disperse onlookers.<b> </b></p><p>• <b><i>If there is a person with a weapon.</i></b><b> </b>Call or send someone to office. You are <i>not </i>required to physically intervene. Try to remain calm. Try not to do anything that will provoke an active shooter. The threat may be high, medium or low risk depending on many factors. One staff member should call police and describe the situation: e.g., static (intruder barricaded somewhere) or dynamic (moving around), any injuries to staff or students, number, location and description of intruders. Also report suspicious devices, with description and location. </p><p>• <b><i>If there is a bomb threat.</i></b> Stay calm. Keep caller on the line. Do not upset the caller. Indicate your willingness to cooperate. Do <i>not</i> pull fire alarm. Signal silently to co-workers to call police, <i>immediately</i>. Permit the caller to say as much as possible without interruption. Take notes on everything said including observation of background noise, voice characteristics, language, etc. Ask as many specific questions as possible. Upon hanging up immediately initiate caller ID if available. Speak with Police. Write everything down. Police will advise if building evacuation is necessary. If so, administration should announce <i>building evacuation</i>. Staff should make a visual check of classroom or immediate area. Anything suspicious should be reported immediately but not touched. School personnel should not handle, search for, or move a suspected bomb. Classroom teacher should evacuate immediate vicinity of any suspicious object. Do not use radios, walkie-talkies or cellular phones to avoid accidentally triggering an explosive device. Staff nearby should turn off stoves, equipment, and gas supply to building. Do not return to the building again until police, fire personnel or administration give the "all clear." </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• <b><i>When you are in transit. </i></b>When traveling to and from school, to reduce vulnerability to random acts of violence, staff and students should use well-travelled, open routes. Walk assertively and be alert to everything around you, and travel with a buddy or escort, especially at night. There may be some circumstances when authorities advise people to vary their routes, to avoid being targets of attack. Avoid dangers by getting away quickly. Scream loudly for help "Call the Police." A variety of professional and community security patrols may all be important to increasing personal safety.\n</p><p><b>Fire:\n</b></p><p>• <b><i>If you see a fire.</i></b> Put out small fires with fire extinguisher or cover source of fuel with blanket. For modern fire extinguisher use, remember "<i>P.A.S.S."</i>: P<i>ull</i> safety pin from handle. A<i>im</i> at base of the flame. S<i>queeze</i> the trigger handle. S<i>weep</i> from side to side at the base of the flame. Shut off source of fuel if safe to do so (e.g., gas). Activate fire alarm. Alert others. Call emergency telephone number and report location of fire. Evacuate building. Close doors and windows. </p><p>• <b><i>If you hear a fire alarm.</i></b><i> </i>Treat as a real emergency. Follow building evacuation procedures. Never open a closed door without checking first for heat. Do not open a hot door.\n</p><p>• <b><i>If you are caught in smoke. </i></b>Drop down on knees and crawl out. Breathe shallowly through your nose. Hold breath as long as possible. Use damp cloth over mouth and nose. </p><p>• <b><i>If trapped in a room by fire. </i></b>Block smoke from entering with damp cloth, under door. Retreat closing as many doors as possible. Signal and phone your location.\n</p><p>• <b><i>If a person or their clothing is on fire.</i></b> Stop where you are. Drop to ground. Roll over. If another person is on fire, push them down, roll them and/or cover with blanket, rug or coat.\n</p><p><b>Earthquake.</b><b><i> </i></b></p><p><b><i>During the shaking:</i></b><b> </b>at first indication of ground shaking, instruct loudly: "Earthquake position: Drop, Cover and Hold On." When the shaking is over, evacuate outdoors, away from the building.\n</p><p>• <b>In classrooms, </b>the person closest to the door should open it fully. Anyone near an open flame should extinguish it. DROP down on your knees and make yourself as D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>small a target as possible. COVER your head, neck and face. GO under a sturdy desk or table to protect your head and neck and as much of your body as possible. HOLD ON to your cover. Stay away from tall and heavy furniture or heavy equipment, and overhead hazards. Do not use elevators. </p><p>• <b>In a wheelchair</b>, lock it and take the "brace position" covering head and neck. If in stadium seating, take the brace position in your seat. </p><p>• <b>In science labs and kitchens, </b>extinguish burners and close hazardous materials containers and/or place out of harm\'s way before taking cover. Stay away from hot stove, overhead cabinets and from hazardous materials that may spill. </p><p>• <b>Inside in open areas, </b>where no cover is available, move towards an interior wall and away from falling and overhead hazards. Drop, Cover and Hold, protecting you head and neck with your arms. </p><p>• <b>In library, workshops, performance areas and kitchen,</b> move away from shelves, books and instruments if possible. </p><p>• <b>In stadium seating,</b> take the "brace position" until the shaking stops. Follow ushers instructions for orderly evacuation. </p><p>• <b>Outdoors, </b>move away from buildings, walls, power lines, trees, light poles and other hazards. Drop down to your knees and cover your head and neck. </p><p>• <b>In school transportation, </b>driver should pull over and stop the vehicle, away from overhead hazards. Take the "brace position." </p><p><b><i>During an aftershock,</i></b> take the same protective measures as during the shaking. </p><p><b><i>After the shaking stops,</i></b> in case of moderate or severe earthquakes, before you exit your room, check around you for anyone injured. Administer life-saving first aid (open airway, stop serious bleeding, treat for shock). Ask responsible students to assist lightly injured. If a severely injured or trapped individual is inside, make them comfortable. Give them a whistle and comfort item and reassure them that search and rescue team will come for them. If staying would be dangerous, non-ambulatory injured should be transported with class. Put out any small fire. Take ten seconds to look around and make a mental note of damage and dangers to report. Mark your door with either green "All Out" sign or red "HELP!/ DANGER!" sign. Leave your doors unlocked. Check for safe exit routes and then carefully evacuate building, moving away from the building. </p><p><b>Tsunami. </b>Evacuate in case of tsunami early warning, or felt-earthquake, to previously-selected <i>safe haven</i> at higher ground and away from coast.\n</p><p><b>Storm. </b>Follow early-warning instructions. Shelter-in-place. </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• <b><i>If you are indoors</i></b><i>, </i>stay off all telephones. Telephone lines can conduct electricity. Unplug televisions, computers and other appliances. Lightning can cause power surges and travel through electric lines. Stay away from running water in faucets, sinks and bathtubs. Electricity from lightning can come inside through plumbing. Close window coverings, then stay away from windows. Listen to weather advisories on a battery-powered radio. Obey advisories promptly.<i> </i></p><p>• <b><i>If you are outdoors,</i></b> plan ahead. Know where you\'ll go if an unexpected thunderstorm develops. Monitor weather conditions and be prepared to take immediate action to get to a safe place before the thunderstorm arrives. If you are boating or swimming, get to land, get off the beach and find a safe place immediately. Stay away from water, which can conduct electricity from lightening.<i> </i>Go to safety in a permanent, closed structure, such as a reinforced building. If there are no reinforced structures, get into a car or bus, keeping windows closed. Keep your hands on your lap and feet off the floor.<i> </i>If you are in the woods, find an area protected by a low clump of trees. Never stand under a single, large tree in the open.<i> </i>As a last resort, go to a low-lying, open place. Stay away from tall things-trees, towers, fences, telephone poles, power lines. Be aware of the potential for flooding in low-lying areas. </p><p>• <b><i>If you feel or see lightening</i></b>,<b> </b>(Note: if you feel your hair stand on end, lightning is about to strike.) squat low to the ground <i>on the balls of your feet</i> so that the charge can go through you back into the ground. Place your hands over your ears and bend your head down. Make yourself the smallest target possible. Do <i>not</i> lie flat on the ground!<i> </i></p><p>• <b><i>If lightning strikes a person</i></b>,<i> </i>call for help. Get someone to dial 9-1-1 or your local number for Emergency Medical Services (EMS). A person who has been struck by lightning needs medical attention as quickly as possible. Give first aid. If the person has stopped breathing, begin rescue breathing (if you are properly trained). If the person\'s heart has stopped beating, someone trained in CPR should administer it. Look and care for other possible injuries and check for burns. Move the victim to a safer place.

Many of your staff will already have some of the response skills described below. Many more skills can be learned from online self-study programs. You can also find training resources in your local community from fire department, civil defence, Red Cross or Red Crescent national society, and other resources. Make an annual staff training plan, to fill in any gaps in the response skills that you will need. Many schools have found that as staff acquire these skills and practice them during drills, they can pass them on to new staff through regular 30-minute, small-group training sessions.\n</p><p>The <b>Incident Commander</b><i> is responsible for directing emergency operations and shall remain at the Command Post ICC to observe and direct all operations.

The contents should include a supply of water (approximately 4 liters of water per person per day<b>-</b>half drinking, half sanitation). This may be used by the school or community, if the school is utilized as a shelter.

Practicing, monitoring, and improving\n</b></p><p><b><i>Hold simulation drills to practice, reflect upon and update your plan\n</i></b></p><p>School drills should be tailored to expected hazards. Every school should conduct at least 3 fire drills per year, and at least one full simulation drill. Schools in earthquake or flood prone areas should also practice for these hazards. For every drill that you perform <i>with </i>a prior announcement, be sure to perform one <i>without </i>a prior announcement. Try them with different scenarios, at different times of the day. Try them when the school principal is there and when he or she is not there. The purpose of a drill is to prepare for the unexpected, so if you make it too easy, you won\'t learn how to adapt to the real situation. Drills should always be treated as "the real thing." </p><p>Good drills are a learning process. They begin with advance preparation by staff, providing an opportunity to train students in classroom groups, remember procedures, and check on provisions. The simulation itself is an experiential learning opportunity. Following </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>the drill, students can debrief with teachers in the classroom. An "all school" faculty and staff meeting is an important way to debrief, and to discuss ways to improve upon both mitigation measures and response preparedness. The most important part of any drill is the discussion and the updated action plan that comes from the experience. </p><p><b><i>Monitoring indicators for school disaster management\n</i></b></p><p>The <i>School Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist</i> (see Addenda) is offered to guide your reflection on your own progress in implementing school disaster management policies and procedures. It is most rewarding to use this at the beginning of your efforts, to establish your "baseline", and then to repeat this check once a year to measure your progress. These can also be used during preparation for and reflection after school drills, to focus your continuing efforts to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, and assure educational continuity. </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p> 41 </p><h2><p>References\n</p></h2><p>GFDRR and INEE, Guidelines Notes on Safer School Construction, 2009. <i>http://www.in-eesite.org/index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/ </i></p><p>Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE)<i>, Minimum Standards Handbook (2010), http://www.ineesite.org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/.\n</i>International Finance Corporation, <i>Disaster and Emergency Management Activity Guide for K-6th grade Teachers 2010.\n</i></p><p>International Finance Corporation, <i>General Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.

Safe school buildings;\n</p><p>2. Disaster prevention education;\n</p><p>3. School disaster and emergency management.\n</p><p><b>Safe school buildings </b>is addressed in the GFDRR/INEE publication, <i>Guidance Notes on Safer School Construction</i> (2009), available in several languages: <i>http://www.ineesite.org/ index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/</i> or <i>http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=10478.\n</i></p><p>In the project development process (new construction, retrofit, and/or remodeling) many of the most critical issues related to school site selection, design for hazard-resilience, and supervised construction should have been addressed. However, the sustainability of safety, the maintenance of school facilities, and the responsibility for educational continuity, rest squarely with the administration and authorities to whom the building is handed over.\n</p><p><b>Disaster prevention education</b> is addressed in the companion publication, <i>Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Activity Guide for K-6th Grade Teachers (IFC 2010)</i> that provides suggested activities for introduction of basic disaster awareness and prevention at an age-appropriate level for primary school students. Integrating disaster prevention knowledge and action into students\' education at school is of critical importance to building a long-term and sustainable "culture of safety" http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13988.\n</p><p>The subject of this handbook, school disaster and emergency preparedness, falls in the middle (yellow) sphere below. Emergency and Disaster Preparedness: Guidance for Schools(2010) is the area that is at the core of "sustainability" of comprehensive school safety. It addresses all of those risk reduction, preparedness and response issues that must be </p><h4><p>C\n</p><p>om prehensive School Safety\n</p></h4><p>addressed and implemented at the local school level, by the school community. <i>http://www. preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13989</i>.\n</p><p>There are also policy issues to be addressed by education authorities at all levels. The international <i>Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies</i>\'<i> (INEE), Minimum Standards Handbook,</i> for education in disasters, addresses emergencies from prevention through to recovery. They are designed to ensure that communities are meaningfully involved in the design and delivery of education programs in emergencies, that efforts are coordinated, accountable, and support the education sector in "building back better." <i>http://www.ineesite. org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/</i>.

Electrical power, water, gas and sewer systems have failed in many areas. The school\'s telephones do not work. Some highways near by are damaged and traffic is not moving. Local surface streets are also blocked. Numerous fires have started due to fallen electrical lines and explosions caused by damaged underground gas lines. We assume that there will be a state of emergency and all staff except those with prior permission are expected to remain at school. Police and Fire Departments are overwhelmed and cannot be reached.

The drill will be based on a hypothetical scenario for a flood that occurs during the 5th day of rain, generates massive flood runoff when the river spills over its banks or floodgates are thrown open to prevent a dam burst. This is unlike anything experienced in the past 100 years. The principal has received a telephone call warning of the immanent flooding.

Pull the pin, aim at the base of the fire, squeeze the nozzle and sweep at the base of the fire.\n</p><p>�• It is highly recommended that you complete your own family disaster plan at home and your plan with your own childcare providers. Please prepare yourself at home and at work in the event you are needed to stay longer than your scheduled day. The principal or designee will release staff members as the needs change. If you have very extenuating circumstances discuss these with your principal NOW, not during an emergency.\n</p><p>�• Plan a quiet activity that students can do in the assembly area in the event of a real emergency or a drill.\n</p><p>�• In case of disaster before or soon after the end of the school day, please be prepared to return to school to provide assistance to students.\n</p><p><b>Teachers: Prepare your students\n</b></p><p>�• Encourage your students to take all drills very seriously. </p><p>�• Practice building evacuation with your classroom and with neighboring classroom.

They also provide an important resource for classroom activities and awareness-raising among children and communities.\n\nPlanning for natural disasters and emergencies is something every educational institution must consider, regardless of its size or location.\n\nIt is not possible to plan for every eventuality that might occur; however, preparation is key to saving lives if a disaster strikes.\n\nIFC takes health, safety, and environmental issues very seriously-in relation to its own workplaces and those of its clients and partners.\n\nThese guides draw on a range of resources and experience including that of the World Bank Group\'s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines and the work of the Risk Reduction Education for Disasters group (Risk RED).\n\nThe guides were prepared as part of IFC\'s Health and Education Advisory Services Project (567768). We acknowledge the work of Marla Petal and Rebekah Green.\n\nGuy Ellena\n\nDirector, Health and Education IFC viii\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMore than 400 national disasters take place every year, affecting more than 230 mil-lion people and causing an average of almost 75,000 deaths annually (CRED, 2008). Worldwide, 450 cities with populations over 1 million face recurring earthquakes. Cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes are among the deadliest and costliest of disasters. Droughts and desertification currently affect 250 million people and threaten 1.2 billion people in 110 countries (UNESCO, 2007). Annually recurring floods regularly prevent millions of children from attending a full year of school.\n\nEducation is a human right, universal and inalienable. Education is especially important in enabling people to reach their full potential and exercise other rights. This right does not disappear or get suspended because of disasters and emergencies. When education is interrupted or limited, students drop out, with negative and permanent economic and social impacts for students, their families, and their communities. Natural hazards are part of the context for educational planning. Whether it is annually recurring floods, a once-in-5-generations earthquake, the increasing severity of storms and cyclones, water shortages, or the slow onset of rising sea water levels, these known and expected hazards can be mitigated with the determined application of knowledge, education, and ingenuity.\n\nWe are not able to prevent the earth from shaking, the wind from blowing, or the rain from falling. However, with assessment and planning, physical and environmental protection and response preparedness we can prevent these events from becoming disasters. Since schools are our universal institution for sharing knowledge and skills, the expectations for schools to be role models in disaster prevention is high. Successful disaster mitigation is one of the ultimate tests of the success of the education we provide over generations.\n\nThis Handbook is written for administrators, teachers, support staff, and other individuals involved in emergency and disaster preparedness atschool. Its purposes are:\n\n• To guide administrators and staff in assessing risks and planning and carrying out physical protection measures;\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• To develop skills and provisions for disaster and emergency preparedness, response, and rapid recovery;\n\n• To support schools in developing disaster and emergency plans specific to their local needs and reflecting good practices internationally and nationally.\n\nThis handbook has been prepared with a primary focus on \'school safety\' and thus the language used throughout refers to \'schools\' versus \'universities\'. However, the underlying tenets in terms of the development of policy, planning and implementation is equally relevant regardless of the type of institution in question.\n\n3\n\nSchool Disaster Management\n\nSchool Disaster Management is the process of assessment and planning, physical protection and response capacity development designed to: 1. Protect students and the staff from physical harm; 2. Minimize disruption and ensure the continuity of education for all children; 3. Develop and maintain a culture of safety.\n\nSchool safety and educational continuity require a dynamic, continuous process ini-tiated by management and involving workers, students, parents, and the local com-munity. School disaster management involves the familiar cycle of steps found in all project management: assess hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities and resources; plan and implement for physical risk reduction, maintenance of safe facilities, standard operating procedures and training for disaster response; test mitigation and preparedness plans and skills regularly, with realistic simulation drills; and revise your plan based on your experience.\n\nSchool disaster management mirrors individual and family disaster prevention, and wider community disaster prevention efforts. This guidance document is organized to help remember and observe the parallel processes for disaster prevention that are taken up at every level of society. The full scope of activities is included as follows:\n\n1. Assessment and planning - establishing or empowering your school disaster management committee; assessing your risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities; making contingency plans for educational continuity; communicating your plan. 2. Physical and environmental protection - structural safety maintenance, nonstructural mitigation; local infrastructure and environmental mitigation; fire safety.\n\n3. Response capacity development - standard operating procedures; response skills and organization; response provisions.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n4.

Assessment and planning\n\nAssessment and planning is the starting point for all thoughtful mitigation and safety efforts. For without assessment, planning is arbitrary and without planning, assessment has no purpose. The steps below can be accomplished in a matter of days.\n\nEstablish or empower your school disaster and emergency management committee\n\nSchool safety is the job of the entire school community. This effort requires leadership and coordination by school administration, and involvement and participation from all sectors of the school community.\n\nEach school should establish and maintain an ongoing School Disaster Management Committee (also called a School Safety Committee, or School Disaster and Emergency Management Committee) to oversee disaster risk reduction and preparedness. This may be the job of a pre-existing committee, sub-committee with a similar mission, or one newly established for this purpose. This committee develops, adapts, implements, and updates the school disaster management plan. It will typically meet intensively at the beginning of each school year and monthly during the school year. It will encourage personal and organizational preparedness, guide mitigation work, assure two fire and building evacuation drills annually, lead one full simulation drill annually, evaluate the results, and adjust the plan accordingly. Ideally, the committee is empowered by and maintains formal links between school and disaster management authorities.\n\nSchool Disaster Management Committee members need strong leadership (ideally the school principal or assistant principal). The committee is most effective when it involves representatives of all major stakeholder groups, such as those listed below:\n\n• School administration;\n\n• Teachers - larger schools should make sure that all major departments or sections of school faculty and staff are represented;\n\n• Staff - this includes facilities, maintenance, nutrition, security, health, counseling, transportation etc.\n\n• Parents - this should be linked to the parent-teacher association or similar school welfare committee;\n\n• School neighbors - this includes neighborhood civic association, large businesses, and public safety officials. It may be accomplished through communication and liaison where appropriate with police, fire services, emergency management authorities, neighborhood association, local business partners, school board, neighborhood elected officials and so on;\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• Vulnerable groups members - it may also be important to have an individual representing people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups whose needs might otherwise be overlooked;\n\n• Students - ideally, this will be an elected representative from the student body.\n\nRepresentatives are needed to facilitate two-way communication between all concerned groups, in the process of planning.\n\nMembers should remember that resilience is not accomplished all at once, but is a continuous process that can be broken down into small steps. Every small step is important in reaching the goals of safety and educational continuity. The committee might start by creating a calendar of activities to develop awareness and build momentum throughout the school year. Major milestones include:\n\n• Form or re-form committee;\n\n• Distribute Family Disaster Plan forms to staff, students and families;\n\n• Complete School Hazard Impact Assessment;Identify vulnerabilities and capacities;\n\n• Prioritize mitigation activities;\n\n• Develop staff training plan;\n\n• Review basic emergency and standard operating procedures;\n\n• Conduct school and neighborhood hazard hunt;\n\n• Check School Evacuation Route Maps posted in each classroom and corridor;\n\n• Check fire suppression equipment;\n\n• Identify campus and neighborhood risks, and resources on maps;\n\n• Post neighborhood and school campus maps prominently;\n\n• Check and re-supply administration, nursing office, and classroom Go-Bags;\n\n• Request student comfort kits from families;\n\n• Check and re-supply first aid kits and emergency supplies;\n\n• Communicate student-family reunification procedures to parents;\n\n• Update student emergency release permissions;\n\n• Schedule fire drill and full simulation drills;\n\n• Practice drills with each class;\n\n• Minimum of two annual fire and building evacuation drills;\n\n• Implement full simulation drill for other hazards.\n\n• Evaluate drill and revise plans and procedures.\n\nIt is a good idea to have one large school safety bulletin board in a prominent location, which the committee can use to share information and to create and maintain disaster pre-\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nvention awareness in the school community. It is particularly important for the committee to remember that students of all ages can and should be involved, as much as possible and as appropriate, in all aspects of school disaster prevention. This learning experience will contribute to a culture of safety for future generations. Students can be involved as rotating classroom representatives, student government volunteers, scout volunteers, and through extra-curricular activities.\n\nA School Disaster Plan is always a work-in-progress, and never a finished document. Successful plans emphasize planning as a process, rather than a neatly bound document. In the course of the steps below, you will generate and re-generate live documentation that will constitute your "plan." What is of crucial importance is having everyone participate in the planning, and learning and continuing to develop the plan through practice.\n\nAssess risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities\n\nRisks are assessed by considering potential hazards (whether these are natural, man-made, or combined), in relationship to a community\'s vulnerability characteristics (i.e., the circumstances that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard. Vulnerabilities apply to groups of people and to individuals, to the built environment and infrastructure, and to the natural environment. For example, young children, older adults, people with disabilities, poor people, minority language groups, recent immigrants, and illiterate people tend to be more vulnerable. Buildings not constructed to withstand hazards are vulnerable. Coastlines unprotected by coral reefs and mangrove forests are vulnerable to high winds. Marine life is vulnerable to oil spills, and so on.\n\nThe steps below will guide you to document the hazards you face, the vulnerability characteristics of people and places, and the resulting risks. Constructing your own risk matrix can help to see the larger picture, and focus and prioritize your efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and risks. This should be approached through research and dialogue.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nAssessing your hazards and risks\n\nUsing the Risk Assessment Matrix in the Addenda, work as a group to fill in the chart, taking these steps:\n\nA. Identify all of the hazards that your school community may face. These may be of "natural" and/or "man-made" origin.\n\nB. Discuss how likely these hazards are. In the case of earthquake, flood, volcano, landslide and similar, check with scientific and technical or disaster management authorities to be sure that you have an accurate understanding of these likelihoods. Some hazards are ever-present, some seasonal, some increase, and some are infrequent but inevitable. Rate the likelihood on a scale of 1 to 5. You should be planning for what may happen sometime during your school career, or your children and grandchildren\'s school years.\n\nHAZARDS 1 2 3 4 5\n\nLikelihood Very low Low Medium High Very high\n\nC. Rate the impact severity for each of these hazards on a scale of 1 to 5. When rating impact severity, consider the wide range of losses that your school and community face, including these factors:\n\n• Human-deaths, injuries, disability;\n\n• Physical-damage to buildings, equipment, supplies;\n\n• Socia Cultural-disruption and loss of friends, mentors, communities, cultural heritage;\n\n• Economic-cost of repair and replacement, cost to students and families of delayed or incomplete education, loss of livelihoods in education;\n\n• Environmental-loss of natural resources and habitats;\n\n• Psychosocial-lost continuities, hopes and dreams;\n\n• Educational-disrupted or degraded services, quality, outcomes.\n\nYour community may be better prepared for some hazards than for others. As you reduce your vulnerabilities there will be less to worry about.\n\nVULNERABILITIES 1 2 3 4 5\n\nImpact severity Minor Controllable Critical Devastating Terminal\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nD.

The location, design and construction of a building can increase or decrease your school\'s vulnerability in the case of fire, earthquake, flood, landslide, snow or windstorm, extreme temperature, volcanic hazards, or bomb threats.\n\nIf you have identified these hazards as priorities, ideally you will already have taken structural safety measures in the course of school site selection and school construction, retrofit or remodeling. Note that for IFC projects, structural engineers and architects responsible for facilities, buildings, plants and structures should certify the applicability and appropriateness of the design criteria employed (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.81).\n\nThe School Building Safety Checklist in the Addenda will help you to identify any issues that would benefit from a closer look. This includes:\n\n• Location and soil;\n\n• Load carrying system;\n\n• Building height;\n\n• Design;\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• Construction detailing;\n\n• Water damage.\n\nIdentify any structural safety concerns that may require further investigation. You may need the support of a qualified engineer or architect to undertake this assessment with you. If any of these conditions apply to your buildings, you will need to investigate further with professional engineering help. As warranted by engineering investigation, develop a strategy for mitigating structural deficiencies through retrofitting or during ongoing remodeling.\n\nAssessing non-structural safety\n\nIf you have prioritized fire, earthquake, flood, and windstorms you will need to take a step further to assess non-structural risks associated with your buildings. This will help to identify those measures that can be taken to make classrooms, offices, and common spaces safer. The review team should include users of each space as well as facilities maintenance staff. Use your imagination and common sense as you go from room to room, and around the building.\n\nFire prevention and fire safety measures are part of your initial school design, and also require regular maintenance and testing. Assess to be sure that:\n\n• Flammable and hazardous materials sources are limited, isolated, eliminated, or secured. This includes electrical lines and appliances, heaters and stoves, natural gas pipes and LPG canisters, flammable or combustible liquids;\n\n• Exit routes are clear to facilitate safe evacuation in case of fire or other emergency;\n\n• Detection and alarm systems are working;\n\n• Fire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n\n• Other fire suppression and control equipment is regularly tested and maintained;\n\n• Mechanical, electrical, and civil structures and systems are maintained and operable, in compliance with life and fire safety design criteria (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.80).\n\nFor cyclone/high winds safety think about objects that can be torn away, fly away or be battered by wind outside. Note what can be done, and who should do it.\n\nFor earthquake safety think about objects that may slide, fall, or fly, and especially anything that can cause injury or block exits. Note what can be done, who should do it, and when it should be completed.\n\nPrioritize the items as follows:\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Priority 1: secure items that can kill or injure or block exits (e.g., heavy equipment, heating/cooling units, pipes, storage tanks, overhead lighting, bookshelves, hazardous chemicals, things blocking exits). Note that all exit doors should open outwards.\n\n• Priority 2: secure things can cause significant economic or cultural loss, cause injury, or impair educational continuity (e.g., computers, audio-visual equipment, school awards, and breakables).\n\n• Priority 3: secure things that, if damaged, can impede recovery.\n\nAssessing capacities and resources for mitigation, response and recovery\n\nYour school community also has many strengths, capacities and resources that need to be identified and mobilized. As you read through this guide you will develop a good grasp of some of the physical protection measures, as well as response and recovery skills and resources that you will need. Make a list of all of these needs. Then, in your school community, identify the people and places with the knowledge, skills, and provisions you need, and find out how you can activate that capacity to reduce your risks and speed your recovery. Identify resources and problem-solve to fill the gaps. Include name, skills/resources, location and contact information.\n\nIn terms of knowledge and skills for risk reduction, think about: structural engineers, environmental engineers, safety experts, facilities staff, handymen, plumbers, electricians, builders. For response and recovery, think about: emergency management experts, health professionals, volunteer groups, scouts, women, organizing volunteers, obtaining supplies, communication experts, shelter construction, and supplies management. Find out what response skills your staff and students already have. Use this assessment to plan for needed training to fill the gaps.\n\nFinally, consider the provisions you will need for response and recovery. As a rule of thumb, collectively as a community you should plan to be able to take care of yourselves for seven days. Between home, school, and work everyone will need four liters of water per person/per day, high energy food. As a school community you will be expected to provide leadership in this. Planning for shelter and sanitation and a site for stockpiling communal supplies are all reasonable expectations from schools.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nCreative problem solving to bridge the gap between needs and resources: in one university, a single supplier delivers drinking water to many buildings and departments, but none had extra supplies. The university made a one-time purchase of emergency water supplies. Now the water supplier uses this stockpile to distribute throughout the university, and re-stocks it, so that the university will always have a fresh emergency water supply.\n\nUsing school and neighborhood risk and resource maps\n\nSchool site map and neighborhood maps are indispensible tools for recording and visualizing risks and resources on your campus and in your community. They will help you recognize and think through how to fill the gaps between vulnerabilities and capacities.\n\nOn the School Map mark vulnerabilities and resources such as:\n\n• Entrances and exits\n\n• Visitor check-in point\n\n• Emergency assembly area\n\n• Gas line shut off location(s)\n\n• Electricity shut off location(s)\n\n• Water shut off location(s)\n\n• Building evacuation routes\n\n• Building dangers\n\n• Underground dangers\n\n• Overhead dangers\n\n• Hazardous materials locations\n\n• Fire suppression equipment locations\n\n• First Aid staging area\n\n• Request and Reunification gates\n\n• Individuals with disabilities and young children\n\n• Response provisions on-site\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nOn the Neighborhood Map mark vulnerabilities and resources such as:\n\n• Emergency evacuation routes\n\n• Emergency vehicle routes\n\n• Alternate assembly area, shelters, and safe havens\n\n• Health facilities\n\n• Fire station\n\n• Hazardous materials sites\n\n• Tools (e.g., generator)\n\n• Resource people\n\n• Transportation resources\n\n• Vulnerable populations (elderly, young children)\n\n• Vulnerable building, roads, and facilities\n\n• Resource people for response and recovery\n\n• Response provisions off-site\n\nPost these maps on your school safety bulletin board, and make them part of your staff handbook and staff orientation. Review and revise these maps as you develop and revise your disaster prevention plan.\n\nContingency planning for educational continuity\n\nWhen students are out-of-school for any prolonged period of time, drop-out rates increase, resulting in lifelong negative impacts. Staff unemployment also follows. In addition to all of the steps taken for hazard and resource assessment, physical protection, and response capacity development, you will also need to have contingency plans for how to continue providing education to students as quickly as possible following hazard impact. This is especially true for schools that face recurring hazards such as annual floods. Alternate sites, temporary shelters, delivery of homework packets, radio and television delivery of lessons are just some of the creative alternatives for making sure that education continues. In the post-disaster period, students will also need to participate in recovery efforts, and have time set aside for a variety of psychosocial support activities, and opportunities for communal grief recovery, to ease their adjustment to the sudden losses in their lives. This may include people, homes, jobs, communities and tangible cultural heritage.\n\nYour school, if in good condition, may also be called upon to be used as an emergency shelter, further disrupting education. If you use private services for security, catering and transportation, these companies should be included in your planning process. Have memoranda of understanding ahead of time with engineers who can inspect your building for safety, water pumping equipment providers, and various other contingency steps can be taken in advance and speed your recovery.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nCommunicating your plan\n\nSchool faculty and staff, students, parents, and local community leaders and first responders all need to be familiar with your plans, in order for them to work effectively. Community members have a great deal to offer the school disaster management process, supporting in risk reduction activities, participating in school drills, volunteering during response and recovery, and providing response supplies.\n\nYou may want to hold special meetings with local public safety representatives, and an open meeting for your entire school community to communicate your plans and invite participation and support. Communicate this information in as many ways as possible (written, audio, visual, demonstration, and through younger students). Translate as necessary to include everyone.\n\nStaff need to understand your expectations of them. If a disaster occurs, when are they expected to report to work? How they will organize shifts? Which individuals may not be able to stay because young children or elderly family members are at home. Open discussion and realistic planning will help. Everyone will want to know what notification systems you will be using (telephone tree, posted notice on building, radio, automated phone messages, e-mail, school web-page).\n\nParents need to be knowledgeable and involved. It is essential for disaster preparedness that parents know and trust that their children will be safe and cared for at school, until the danger has passed or outside help arrives, even for two to three days! Let them know, in advance, all emergency procedures.\n\nClearly explain student release procedures to parents, students and community members. Students will be released only to parent/guardian or other pre-authorized emergency contact (who should bring photo identification with them). Provide information about alternate evacuation and reunification site, especially if your school grounds are not likely to be safe because of nearby hazards. Explain that in case of a lockdown, the school will not be able to answer incoming phone calls or make outside calls. Police will provide assistance. No one, including parents, will be allowed near the school. Students will be kept inside and not permitted to leave until the lockdown is lifted by the police. After that, parents may come to school to pick up their children.\n\nAs part of this communication process, you should ask parents to provide:\n\n• Emergency contact information: in order to implement student release procedures, be sure that parent and emergency contact information is updated at the beginning of each school year and that parents notify the school of changes during the school year.\n\n• Student comfort bags: these hold essential supplies each child in case of emergency (see Section 3.C below).\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nAnd last but not least, students will be empowered participants in disaster prevention, now and in the future, if they are fully and thoughtfully included in communicating school safety plans.\n\n2. Physical and environmental protection\n\nYour plan to reduce vulnerability and risks will need to consider:\n\n• Structural safety - this addresses the safety of buildings on or near the school site;\n\n• Non-structural safety - this addresses the threats posed by building furnishings and equipment as well as building elements such as roofs, windows, stairs, heating and cooling systems, water storage, pipes, and exit routes. This includes fire safety;\n\n• Local infrastructure - this addresses lifeline utilities such as water, electricity, gas, as well as communications and transportation conduits. It also covers transportation safety;\n\n• Environmental mitigation - this addresses ambient conditions such as temperature, inundation, hazardous materials release, and climate change impacts.\n\nThe dos and don\'ts below will assist in identifying and implementing these protection measures.\n\nStructural safety maintenance\n\nWhile implementation of structural safety measures is beyond the scope of this document, building maintenance is a critical component in the maintenance of structural and nonstructural safety. Damage should be repaired as discovered, and structural safety should not be compromised through alteration and misuse. Responsibility for this rests with local school administration and designated facilities and maintenance personnel.\n\nCheck to be sure that you:\n\n• Do not compromise columns or beams by cutting, exposing, or making holes in them;\n\n• Do not let reinforcing steel be exposed to air or moisture;\n\n• Do cover exposed steel with concrete mortar;\n\n• Fix wood rot, cracked mortar, cracked bricks, and concrete damage;\n\n• Keep gutters and drainage systems clear of debris;\n\n• Make sure that water and moisture drains away from building;\n\n• Replace broken glass.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nNon-structural safety\n\nNon-structural safety measures are those that are not connected with the weight-bearing system of the building, and those that are in the hands of users. This includes fire prevention and readily available fire suppression equipment. Special attention is required to make sure that all building occupants can safely exit in case building evacuation is necessary. In case of earthquake and storms, the main considerations are injury prevention both within and immediately outside buildings.\n\nDo check that:\n\n• All classroom doors, doors of high-occupancy rooms, and doors to outside open outwards;\n\n• Exit pathways are kept clear;\n\n• Non-structural building elements are securely fastened to the building to resist wind or earthquake\n\n• shaking;\n\n• Fire suppression equipment is located appropriately and maintained in good working condition;\n\n• Flammable and combustible materials are limited, isolated, eliminated, and separated, away from • dangerous interactions and heat sources;\n\n• Electrical systems are maintained and are not overloaded;\n\n• Classrooms have two exits wherever possible. (Sometimes the second exit is a window.)\n\nIf you face earthquakes and windstorms:\n\n• Move heavy items below head level;\n\n• Tightly secure tall and heavy furniture and appliance to walls, floors and ceilings. (e.g., use L-brackets to walls or spring-loaded adjustable tension rods to ceiling or wedges under bottom front, or strip barrier fastened to tabletop, as appropriate);\n\n• Fasten cabinet doors and drawers with latches that will hold shut during shaking; Secure heaters and cooling systems suspended inside or outside of building;\n\n• Fasten liquid propane gas tanks, fire extinguishers and other gas cylinders to the wall;\n\n• Protect from glass that may break into large shards (e.g., rearrange furniture, use window film, curtains, or install strengthened glass.);\n\n• Secure heavy and important electronic items to table top or floor using straps and\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Secure lighting fixtures to ceiling;\n\n• Fasten pictures on closed hooks;\n\n• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials.\n\nAnd for floods:\n\n• Raise important items above possible flood level;\n\n• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials above flood level.\n\nLocal infrastructure safety\n\nLocal infrastructure includes the water, electricity, gas, heating and cooling systems, communications and transportation systems in your area. These are usually part of larger systems maintained by government and private agencies. Careful design and problem-solving with these organizations, ahead of time, can protect students and educational assets, and make these systems resilient. Depending on the hazards faced, a wide variety of solutions can be considered:\n\n• Relocate overhead wires and poles that may block exit routes;\n\n• Install automatic natural gas shut off valves at building level;\n\n• Use flexible connectors for pipes;\n\n• Consider dangers posed by overhead and underground pipes and depots;\n\n• Replace radioactive lightening rods with those that do not pose health risk.\n\nTransportation safety may involve road and pedestrian crossing conditions as well as operations of school or contractor buses or minivans. On an annual basis, worldwide, transportation accidents are the leading cause of student deaths and injuries. Clear lines of sight and signage, stop signs, traffic lights, clearly marked pedestrian crosswalks, and crossing-guards at busy crossings are all important safety measures. Vehicle safety, driver testing and training, and installation, maintenance, and use of seat belts, and careful routing are all of importance in ensuring that students are safe in school transport. Once on school transportation, rules of access and conduct, and adult supervision are also important factors.\n\nEnvironmental safety\n\nEnvironmental safety issues bring schools into focus in their local environments. Thinking through all of the conditions that you face, what are some of the environmental safety issues to explore to increase your own safety?\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nThere are other ways that your school community can be involved in environmental protection and climate change mitigation-through "green school" measures and through community activities such as environmental clean-up, anti-litter signage, awareness campaigns and similar activities to encourage citizens to reduce, re-use and recycle.\n\n3. Response capacity development\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle involves the development of response capacity. This includes the systematic organization of response, standard response skills (including basic emergency procedures and procedures for specific hazards), and accessing provisions during an emergency. Details on each follows.\n\nResponse organization using Incident Command Systems (ICS)\n\nResponse capacity involves knowledge, procedures, skills, and provisions. The most important aspect of response capacity is organization and mobilization of existing skills and resources. A standard emergency management system, such as Incident Command Systems (ICS) shown in the diagram at the bottom of this section, can be used as a guiding framework for coordinating the many standard functions that may be called for in different emergency situations.\n\nIncident command systems\n\nThe purpose of ICS is to ensure that the most help reaches the most people, and to provide a consistent system that staff, students, and emergency personnel can apply in any school, anywhere. Key principles are:\n\nConditions Solutions to explore\n\nExtreme weather during school year school design, alternate locations, alternate delivery methods\n\nLandslide tree-planting, slope stabilization, retaining wall, evacuation routes\n\nForest fires fire breaks\n\nTsunami evacuation routes, stairs, ladder\n\nDrought / Food insecurity rainwater harvesting, school gardens, tree planting, food storage\n\nSolid waste management recycling point\n\nWater and energy shortage and costs water and energy conservation\n\nHazardous materials production or storage\n\ncommunity "right-to-know", regular review of safety measures, facility tours and dialogues\n\nAir pollution walking and bicycling to school, car-pooling\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Standardization - the use of common terminology (and no codes);\n\n• Unified chain of command in order to assign resources for maximum effectiveness;\n\n• Flexible, modular organization, mobilized as needed; and\n\n• Integrated communications.\n\nThere are five key functions in ICS are that can be mobilized as needed in the particular circumstances. These five functions form a common approach to organize response to any emergency or disaster. Depending on the number of staff and trusted volunteers or capable older-students available, some people may need to have multiple roles.\n\n• Incident command: these are decision-makers (responsible for/set mission) Although someone in your school may be designated as "Emergency Manager" under normal circumstances, in case of actual disaster or emergency, the "Incident Commander" is the first capable person on the scene, until that function can be transferred to a more qualified person or higher authority. Even if normally that person is a Principal or Assitant Principal, several different people should practice in this role, as those indiviuals may or may not be available during an actual emergency or disaster. The "Incident Commander" mobilizes the on-site "Incident Command Center."\n\n• Communications team: these are communicators (listeners and talkers)\n\nThe communications team is the right arm of the Incident Commander, establishing connections with education administration, public safety, and emergency management authorities, and with parents and the public, as directed. When communications systems are operational some information can be disseminated using telephone trees, and radio announcements. In large-scale disasters the key communications are with students (often by the school principal or assistant principal, using a megaphone to communicate) and with parents anticipating reunification with students.\n\n• Operations branch: these are doers (carry out the mission)\n\nThis branch requires a highly organized and well-respected Operations Chief, who manages teams to fulfill: light search and rescue, fire suppression and hazardous materials control, utility shut-off, disaster first aid, psychosocial support, security, and student release/family reunification functions.\n\n• Logistics branch: these are getters/supporters (support the mission)\n\nThis branch requires a Logistics Chief, who knows the site and its resources best. These teams will find and distribute supplies and provisions, shelter and sanitation, water and nutrition, and organize volunteer recruitment and assignment.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• Information and planning: these are documenters and analyzers (support the mission)\n\nThis branch is typically mobilized in advance of a disaster, identifying and researching resources, executing memoranda of understanding in advance. During an incident it documents the situation, activities, and assures accurate record keeping.\n\n• Finance/administrators: these are payers (pay and negotiate)\n\nThis function typically keeps records of resources and staff time expended during any emergency, arranging compensation where permitted, and negotiating as needed for access to needed resources.\n\nICS is a flexible system that can be activated to different levels, depending on the situation. For example, an intruder on campus, a fight between students, or traffic accident might be handled by activating Level I alone. A small fire or flood might require Level II activation. A major disaster, such as an earthquake might require full activation of multiple teams at Level III. Maintaining this structure allows more responders to be integrated, maintaining the chain of command, and a manageable span of control (i.e., 5-8 people per supervisor). It is not normally recommended to have permanent teams with single functions because each situation differs, and may call for more or fewer people on any particular team. As much as resources permit, staff should cross-train. Even if response teams are formed ahead of time, staff should understand and be prepared to assume any response role, as needed. Incident Command Systems are designed to be flexible, and to activate from the top down, only to the level, and only those functions required by the particular disaster or emergency.\n\nStandard operating procedures\n\nStandard emergency response procedures depend on the hazard, and can and should be customized to your unique circumstances. These are built around six basic emergency procedures detailed below:\n\n• Building evacuation;\n\n• Shelter-in-place;\n\n• Lockdown;\n\n• Assemble and shelter outside;\n\n• Evacuate to safe haven;\n\n• Emergency student release/family reunification.\n\nEach of the procedures is described in detail below. Remember that individuals with disabilities, foreign language speakers and visitors unfamiliar with these procedures may\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nneed assistance in following them. The Emergency Procedures Decision-Tree that follows illustrates the different circumstances that lead to these six basic procedures.\n\nQuestion #1-Is there any warning before the hazard impact? Is the hazard rapid-onset, without warning (such as acts of violence, earthquake, fire), or is it a slow or medium-onset hazard with some early warning (such as floods, cyclone, winter storms, etc.)? In the case of medium onset events with early warning, school maybe closed, and alternate education\n\nIncident Command Systems Organigram\n\nSchool Safety/School Disaster & Emergency Management Committee\n\nSafety Officer\n\nOperations\n\nDamage Assessment Light Search & Rescue\n\nFire Suppression\n\nFirst Aid\n\nPsychosocial Support\n\nStudent Supervision\n\nStudent Release\n\nEquipment & Supplies\n\nVolunteering & Staffing\n\nTransportation & Traffic\n\nShelter & Sanitation\n\nWater & Food\n\n  Planning, Analysis\n\n  & Finance\n\n  Documentation\n\nProcurement\n\nLogistics\n\nAdministration, Finance & Documentation\n\nManagement/ Commander\n\nCommunications Team\n\nLiaison Officer\n\nPublic Information Officer\n\nLevel I\n\nLevel II\n\nLevel III\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\ndelivery methods set into motion. In this case, normal student-release procedures would be applied. In some situations, schools may be the shelter-of-choice for the local community. In the case of violence (person with weapon, terrorist activity) administration should announce a lockdown.\n\nQuestion #2-Is the building safe? The second question is whether the building is safe. If the building is unsafe then building evacuation should be immediately triggered. In the case of rapid onset hazards such as fire and earthquake, the building must be assumed to be unsafe, and therefore cautious building evacuation should be automatically triggered. (Note that during earthquake shaking, everyone should "drop, cover and hold on" and that evacuation should only begin once the shaking has stopped.) In other situations a rapid assessment can be made before evacuation. If the building is safe then the students and staff should be instructed to shelter-in-place. Reverse evacuation is practiced for orderly return from assembly area back into classrooms, to shelter-in-place.\n\nQuestion #3-Are the school grounds are safe? If school grounds are safe then assemble and shelter outside is the procedure. If school grounds are known to be unsafe (e.g., in coastal area with tsunami risk) then automatic evacuation to safe haven should take place. A rapid assessment (e.g., of hazardous materials, fallen power lines, pipeline ruptures) will help decide between these two options.\n\nIn all cases, following assembly, reassessment should take place periodically and one of these actions maintained. In the case of real disasters and emergencies incidents, emergency student release procedures should be initiated, ensuring that students are returned directly and only to the care of parents/guardians or their pre-designated emergency contacts, and each reunion documented. Students should remain cared for and supervised until the last student is reunited and the All Clear is given by the incident commander (explained in the next section). In the case of drills and small events a reverse evacuation may be practiced to return to class, prior to "All Clear" instruction and resumption of classes.\n\nBuilding evacuation, evacuation to safe haven and assembly procedure\n\nAdministration: sounds fire alarm; makes announcement to students and staff. In case of fire, close doors and windows. In case of hazardous materials, close ventilation system. Activate Incident Command System as appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Maintain communication. Announce any new procedure. Announce "All Clear" when emergency has ended.\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nStaff: ahead of time, practice as a class, following both fire and earthquake procedures. Identify any students or staff who may need special assistance during evacuation. Learn from these individuals how best to help them. Teach students how to provide assistance ahead of time. In schools with large numbers of disabled students needing assistance, volunteers should be recruited from the immediate vicinity and trained. Be prepared to help visitors as well.\n\nAt time of alarm or after earthquake shaking stops:\n\n1. Remind students to follow instructions for building evacuation: "Don\'t Talk. Don\'t Push. Don\'t Run. Don\'t Turn Back." Students should exit with buddies in twos. Check that students or staff needing special assistance have it. Remind students NOT to use cell phones, to keep lines free for emergency communications!\n\n2. Take your:\n\n• Classroom Go-Bag or Go-Bucket;\n\n• Emergency clipboard or notebook with class lists and Class Status Report Forms (See Addenda);\n\n• Duffle bag packed with student comfort bags.\n\n3. Use the buddy system. Take a few seconds to check briefly with the teacher in the classroom to the left, to the right, and across the hall to see if they are in need. Unless instructed otherwise, evacuate using normal building evacuation routes posted. If you encounter obstructions, such as jammed door, be prepared to take an alternate route. One teacher should be in the front to check that the evacuation route is clear. One responsible student monitor should be immediately behind the teacher, keeping students quiet and orderly. One teacher and responsible student monitor should be at the rear of the group, seeing that everyone is together. Move directly away from the building when exiting. Designated teachers from each wing should check washrooms as they exit.\n\n4. Take your seat in the emergency assembly area (normally, organized by first period or homeroom class). Keep classes separate and take roll. Check again for injuries. If any students are injured, send them with two buddies to the First Aid station, with instructions to return together immediately. For large schools, mount your classroom identification sign at front of group above head level. Fill out your Classroom Status Report Form and return it to Incident Command Center with student runner.\n\n5. Remind students about student-release procedures and their purpose to keep them safe. Remind them not to use their cell phones in order to keep lines open for emergency. For emergency communication, use SMS only. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class).\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n6. If you are a member of the Search and Rescue, First Aid Team or Fire Suppression Team, have the teacher next to you supervise your class and proceed to the Incident Command Center.\n\n7. Teachers are to remain with their class AT ALL TIMES. Students must remain seated together as a class. Periodically call roll as needed. Keep students quiet so that they can hear information from the public address or megaphone/bullhorn system that will be used for announcements. Children are to leave only in the company of reunion gate messengers. The Incident Command Center will provide updates and relieve staff of their assignments.\n\nNote: all personnel without a specific duty or class are to immediately report to the Incident Command Center for instructions. All teaching assistants and campus aides who do not have a class are to report immediately to the assembly area to assist with the supervision of students.\n\nEvacuation to safe haven: all schools should designate an alternate site for assembly should school grounds need to be evacuated. Identify evacuation routes ahead of time, and inform parents of this alternate site. Schools that face known risks such as flooding, landslide, debris flow, tsunami, chemical release, or schools that do not have a safe assembly area on-site, should arrange and prepare safe havens ahead of time with emergency supplies. If necessary, also arrange transportation to your safe haven depending on the threats you face, evacuation to safe haven may be automatic (e.g., following earthquake in coastal areas with tsunami threat), or you may wait for evaluation by on-site incident commander and assessment team.\n\nReverse evacuation: there may also be times when it becomes necessary to go back inside, because inside is safer than outside. Practice reverse evacuation at the end of your drills, when you go back to your classrooms, following all of the same rules.\n\nN.B. Always assume and act as though an alarm is signaling a real threat. Whether an alarm is a real situation, a drill, or even a false alarm, safety demands that you practice your response procedures as though it were real event!\n\nShelter in place procedure\n\nYou may be requested to shelter-in-place when there are dangers outside the school that prevent normal student release, such as severe weather or flooding, nuclear, biological or chemical incident or terrorist attack. Shelter-in-place is appropriate when evacuation is not\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nnecessary, or when there is not time to evacuate. It should be announced throughout the school using a public address system or face-to-face communication.\n\nAdministration: 1. Activates Incident Command System as needed. 2. Announces to students and staff to stay in, or return to indoor shelter areas. Close all doors and windows, if appropriate. Turn off ventilation system, if appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Announce "All Clear" when the emergency has ended.\n\nStaff:\n\n1. Clear the halls of students and staff immediately and report to nearest available classroom or pre-designated shelter locations inside the facility.\n\n2. Teachers keep your emergency go-bag or bucket and notebook or clipboard with you.\n\n3. Assist those with special needs.\n\n4. Close all windows and doors and lock entrances, if appropriate.\n\n5. Seal the room from outside air infiltration, shutting off heating, ventilating or cooling system, if appropriate.\n\n6. Take attendance and turn in Class Status Report Form to Incident Commander when safe to do so.\n\n7. Turn on radio/TV and monitor for further information or instruction.\n\n8. Have students leave their cell phones on their desks. In generalized disasters it is important to keep lines open for emergency. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class).\n\n9. Stay where you are until instructed otherwise by school authorities. 10. Create a schedule for learning, recreation, eating and sleeping.\n\nLockdown procedure\n\nLockdowns are called for when there is a violent intruder or person with weapon, if a threat of violence or other crisis occurs inside or outside the school and if moving around or evacuation would be dangerous. A distinct loud siren or alarm should be used to signal immediate lockdown.\n\nAdministration: sound lockdown signal and announce: "Attention-There is an intruder in the building. Initiate lockdown procedure." Do NOT activate fire alarm! Take cover. Activate Incident Command and prepare to transfer command to police or public safety authorities. Monitor situation. Reassess and provide updates and instructions as available.

Following incident inform students and parents, as appropriate, providing time for review and discussion.\n\nStaff:\n\n1. Gather students into classrooms, maintaining calm. Try to warn other faculty, staff, students and visitors to take immediate shelter. If you are outside the building proceed immediately to a secure area, away from the threat.\n\n2. Close and lock the doors from inside. Stay out of sight and stay away from doors and windows. Wherever you are, turn all available desks and/or tables onto their sides facing the hallway and/or outside windows, if necessary.\n\n3. Instruct students to drop and cover behind the desks making themselves as small a target as possible. Do not close coverings on outside windows.\n\n4. Turn off lights and turn off radios and other devices that emit sound. Silence cell phones.\n\n5. Stay where you are until instructed in person by police or school authorities.\n\n6. Follow instructions to continue class and/or use Disaster and Emergency Student Release procedures.\n\nEmergency student release procedure\n\nDisaster and emergency student release procedures are intended to ensure that students and families are safely reunited, following any unsafe or unusual circumstances. In the event of an emergency or disaster, students under the age of 16 should not be permitted to leave school except in the company of an adult approved by parent or guardian.\n\nParents: provide and maintain an updated List of Emergency Contacts for their child. This should include parents or guardians and two or three trusted relatives or friends nearby who will be nearby or come to collect student in case of emergency. In the event of emergency or disaster, the student will only be released to persons on this list or authorized by persons on this list.\n\nAdministration: ensures that List of Emergency Contacts for each student is updated by parents at the beginning of the school year, and can be updated by parents at any time. Maintains the current copy of student emergency contacts in administration office "Go-Box", and annually in the school emergency supplies bin.\n\nTeachers: make sure that both students and parents are familiar with student release procedures for emergencies and disasters.\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nReunification Team: greets parents and emergency contacts at request gate, providing them with Student-Family Reunification Form (permit to release child) form to fill out. Verify that the adult picking up the child is listed on the List of Emergency Contacts and verify their identity. Reunites students at reunification gate. Keeps signed copies of Student-Family Reunification Forms in order to respond to any query. Organizes request and reunification functions for maximum efficiency and safety.\n\nHazard specific response procedures\n\nGeneral:\n\nVisitor registration: to protect visitors from all hazards, and to protect students and staff from intruders, schools must maintain a single entrance and registration system with nametags for visitors, so that staff and students will know that unfamiliar people have identified themselves before moving around on campus. Communicate these rules widely and assist visitors in the registration process.\n\nEmergency calls: when calling for police, ambulance, fire or other emergency services be prepared to describe WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHAT is happening, WHO you are and how to call you back. Do not hang up until told to do so. For personal safety you should program a next-of-kin phone number under the name "ICE" in your cell phone. This is the universal name for "In Case of Emergency".\n\nMedical emergency: provide immediate medical care and call ambulance if necessary.\n\nThreats of Violence: violent incidents at school are not impulsive, random, or epidemic. Prior to most incidents the attacker told someone about his/her idea or plans. There is no accurate profile of a violent offender. Some, but not all violent students have social difficulties, and there are many motivations for violence. Prevention can be achieved by building a climate of trust and respect between students and adults. School should provide a place for open discussion where diversity and differences are allowed and communication is encouraged and supported. Attention must be paid to students\' social and emotional as well as academic needs.\n\nWhenever any threat is made, do not ignore them, and do not over-react. Threats of violence may be: direct- specific act against a specific target identified in a clear and explicit manner; indirect-vague, unclear, ambiguous or implied violence; veiled-implied but not explicitly a threat; conditional-warning of violence, if terms are not met (e.g., extortion). A professionally-trained threat assessment team may need to evaluate whether the threat\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nposes low, medium or high risk, considering student behavior, personality, school, social, and family dynamics.\n\n• If there is a suspicious or unknown persons. If you sense a threat, ask a colleague for immediate help. If you feel threatened trust your feelings. Keep distance. Use assertive verbal language and strong body language. Call police as necessary. Call for immediate lockdown if necessary.\n\n• If you encounter bullying. School culture should not tolerate bullying and anyone witnessing or experiencing bullying should feel comfortable reporting it and knowing that adults will follow up. Supportive family intervention may be needed for both victims and perpetrators of bullying. For more information see http:// www.stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/kids/\n\n• If there is a fight among students. Call or send someone to the office. You are not required to physically intervene. Identify yourself and instruct combatants to stop. Call them by name, instruct spectators to move away. Keep track of events for subsequent report. Dispatch staff to control and disperse onlookers.\n\n• If there is a person with a weapon. Call or send someone to office. You are not required to physically intervene. Try to remain calm. Try not to do anything that will provoke an active shooter. The threat may be high, medium or low risk depending on many factors. One staff member should call police and describe the situation: e.g., static (intruder barricaded somewhere) or dynamic (moving around), any injuries to staff or students, number, location and description of intruders. Also report suspicious devices, with description and location.\n\n• If there is a bomb threat. Stay calm. Keep caller on the line. Do not upset the caller. Indicate your willingness to cooperate. Do not pull fire alarm. Signal silently to co-workers to call police, immediately. Permit the caller to say as much as possible without interruption. Take notes on everything said including observation of background noise, voice characteristics, language, etc. Ask as many specific questions as possible. Upon hanging up immediately initiate caller ID if available. Speak with Police. Write everything down. Police will advise if building evacuation is necessary. If so, administration should announce building evacuation. Staff should make a visual check of classroom or immediate area. Anything suspicious should be reported immediately but not touched. School personnel should not handle, search for, or move a suspected bomb. Classroom teacher should evacuate immediate vicinity of any suspicious object. Do not use radios, walkie-talkies or cellular phones to avoid accidentally triggering an explosive device. Staff nearby should turn off stoves, equipment, and gas supply to building. Do not return to the building again until police, fire personnel or administration give the "all clear."\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• When you are in transit. When traveling to and from school, to reduce vulnerability to random acts of violence, staff and students should use well-travelled, open routes. Walk assertively and be alert to everything around you, and travel with a buddy or escort, especially at night. There may be some circumstances when authorities advise people to vary their routes, to avoid being targets of attack. Avoid dangers by getting away quickly. Scream loudly for help "Call the Police." A variety of professional and community security patrols may all be important to increasing personal safety.\n\nFire:\n\n• If you see a fire. Put out small fires with fire extinguisher or cover source of fuel with blanket. For modern fire extinguisher use, remember "P.A.S.S.": Pull safety pin from handle. Aim at base of the flame. Squeeze the trigger handle. Sweep from side to side at the base of the flame. Shut off source of fuel if safe to do so (e.g., gas). Activate fire alarm. Alert others. Call emergency telephone number and report location of fire. Evacuate building. Close doors and windows.\n\n• If you hear a fire alarm. Treat as a real emergency. Follow building evacuation procedures. Never open a closed door without checking first for heat. Do not open a hot door.\n\n• If you are caught in smoke. Drop down on knees and crawl out. Breathe shallowly through your nose. Hold breath as long as possible. Use damp cloth over mouth and nose.\n\n• If trapped in a room by fire. Block smoke from entering with damp cloth, under door. Retreat closing as many doors as possible. Signal and phone your location.\n\n• If a person or their clothing is on fire. Stop where you are. Drop to ground. Roll over. If another person is on fire, push them down, roll them and/or cover with blanket, rug or coat.\n\nEarthquake.\n\nDuring the shaking: at first indication of ground shaking, instruct loudly: "Earthquake position: Drop, Cover and Hold On." When the shaking is over, evacuate outdoors, away from the building.\n\n• In classrooms, the person closest to the door should open it fully. Anyone near an open flame should extinguish it. DROP down on your knees and make yourself as D\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nsmall a target as possible. COVER your head, neck and face. GO under a sturdy desk or table to protect your head and neck and as much of your body as possible. HOLD ON to your cover. Stay away from tall and heavy furniture or heavy equipment, and overhead hazards. Do not use elevators.\n\n• In a wheelchair, lock it and take the "brace position" covering head and neck. If in stadium seating, take the brace position in your seat.\n\n• In science labs and kitchens, extinguish burners and close hazardous materials containers and/or place out of harm\'s way before taking cover. Stay away from hot stove, overhead cabinets and from hazardous materials that may spill.\n\n• Inside in open areas, where no cover is available, move towards an interior wall and away from falling and overhead hazards. Drop, Cover and Hold, protecting you head and neck with your arms.\n\n• In library, workshops, performance areas and kitchen, move away from shelves, books and instruments if possible.\n\n• In stadium seating, take the "brace position" until the shaking stops. Follow ushers instructions for orderly evacuation.\n\n• Outdoors, move away from buildings, walls, power lines, trees, light poles and other hazards. Drop down to your knees and cover your head and neck.\n\n• In school transportation, driver should pull over and stop the vehicle, away from overhead hazards. Take the "brace position."\n\nDuring an aftershock, take the same protective measures as during the shaking.\n\nAfter the shaking stops, in case of moderate or severe earthquakes, before you exit your room, check around you for anyone injured. Administer life-saving first aid (open airway, stop serious bleeding, treat for shock). Ask responsible students to assist lightly injured. If a severely injured or trapped individual is inside, make them comfortable. Give them a whistle and comfort item and reassure them that search and rescue team will come for them. If staying would be dangerous, non-ambulatory injured should be transported with class. Put out any small fire. Take ten seconds to look around and make a mental note of damage and dangers to report. Mark your door with either green "All Out" sign or red "HELP!/ DANGER!" sign. Leave your doors unlocked. Check for safe exit routes and then carefully evacuate building, moving away from the building.\n\nTsunami. Evacuate in case of tsunami early warning, or felt-earthquake, to previously-selected safe haven at higher ground and away from coast.\n\nStorm. Follow early-warning instructions. Shelter-in-place.\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• If you are indoors, stay off all telephones. Telephone lines can conduct electricity. Unplug televisions, computers and other appliances. Lightning can cause power surges and travel through electric lines. Stay away from running water in faucets, sinks and bathtubs. Electricity from lightning can come inside through plumbing. Close window coverings, then stay away from windows. Listen to weather advisories on a battery-powered radio. Obey advisories promptly.\n\n• If you are outdoors, plan ahead. Know where you\'ll go if an unexpected thunderstorm develops. Monitor weather conditions and be prepared to take immediate action to get to a safe place before the thunderstorm arrives. If you are boating or swimming, get to land, get off the beach and find a safe place immediately. Stay away from water, which can conduct electricity from lightening. Go to safety in a permanent, closed structure, such as a reinforced building. If there are no reinforced structures, get into a car or bus, keeping windows closed. Keep your hands on your lap and feet off the floor. If you are in the woods, find an area protected by a low clump of trees. Never stand under a single, large tree in the open. As a last resort, go to a low-lying, open place. Stay away from tall things-trees, towers, fences, telephone poles, power lines. Be aware of the potential for flooding in low-lying areas.\n\n• If you feel or see lightening, (Note: if you feel your hair stand on end, lightning is about to strike.) squat low to the ground on the balls of your feet so that the charge can go through you back into the ground. Place your hands over your ears and bend your head down. Make yourself the smallest target possible. Do not lie flat on the ground!\n\n• If lightning strikes a person, call for help. Get someone to dial 9-1-1 or your local number for Emergency Medical Services (EMS). A person who has been struck by lightning needs medical attention as quickly as possible. Give first aid. If the person has stopped breathing, begin rescue breathing (if you are properly trained). If the person\'s heart has stopped beating, someone trained in CPR should administer it. Look and care for other possible injuries and check for burns. Move the victim to a safer place. Remember, people struck by lightning carry no electric charge, and they can be handled safely\n\nFlood. Follow early-warning instructions. Evacuate to higher ground or shelter-in-place.\n\n• Slow rise flooding: Given sufficient notice to evacuate prior to flooding, protect records and electronic equipment as best as possible. Take normal actions for building evacuation and proceed to safe haven.\n\n• Sudden severe flooding. Evacuate all affected spaces immediately. Relocate to a safe place on the upper floors of the building, taking Go Bucket or Bag and emer-\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\ngency notebook or clipboard with you. Do NOT try to wade through flood waters of any depth. Do NOT try to leave the building in a car. If you must evacuate, wear life-jackets or similar flotation devices.\n\nHazardous Materials Release. Evacuate upwind to safe haven or shelter-in-place, closing and sealing windows, air-ducts.\n\n• Chemical spills or suspicious materials. If possible, limit release at the source and contain the spill. Shut down equipment. Evacuate the immediate area. If danger extends beyond immediate area, pull fire alarm and follow the building evacuation and assembly procedure. First witness of the hazardous materials leak/spill: call emergency telephone number give details of materials and location, and number of people in the vicinity.\n\n• Gas leak. Do not pull fire alarm-this could cause an explosion. Leave the area and call emergency telephone number. Issue alert using public address system or door-to-door. Evacuate the building following building evacuation and assembly procedure.\n\n• Explosion. Drop and cover under desk, tables or other furniture that will protect you against flying glass and debris. When it is safe refer to the Emergency Call Section and immediately report an explosion. Leave doors open to permit exit, if building is damaged. Stay away from outside walls and areas where there are large pieces of glass and/or heavy suspended light fixtures. Standby for further instructions from your incident commander.\n\nResponse skills\n\nResponse skills associated with different roles in Incident Command Systems are described below. Many of your staff will already have some of the response skills described below. Many more skills can be learned from online self-study programs. You can also find training resources in your local community from fire department, civil defence, Red Cross or Red Crescent national society, and other resources. Make an annual staff training plan, to fill in any gaps in the response skills that you will need. Many schools have found that as staff acquire these skills and practice them during drills, they can pass them on to new staff through regular 30-minute, small-group training sessions.\n\nThe Incident Commander is responsible for directing emergency operations and shall remain at the Command Post ICC to observe and direct all operations. The IC will normally be the school principal, assistant principal or their designee.

Blankets kept in the emergency shed will be used;\n\n• Provide water and food for those people detained beyond meal times;\n\n• Water and food stocks should both be stockpiled and rotated into regular use on an ongoing basis.\n\nResponse provisions\n\nIn case of the need for building or site evacuation, there are some key supplies that need to be ready to take with you. These same supplies will be needed if you have to shelter-in-place. The checklists provided in the Addenda recommend supplies to be maintained by administration, nursing office, in each classroom, and schoolwide.\n\nThe school administration office "go-box" should staff and student class roster and schedules, and for elementary and secondary schools it should contain Student Emergency Contact Cards, and student check-in and absentee log and daily visitors log, school site map, important phone numbers, keys, and office supplies.\n\nThe nursing office go-box should contain student prescription medications and first aid supplies. School first aid kit contents should be appropriate to the size of your school. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nEach classroom should have a classroom "go-bag" or "go-bucket." These "evacuation supplies" should be taken on field trips, and can also be used in case of lockdown or shelter-in-place (where the bucket can serve as a makeshift toilet). Each room will also need an emergency clipboard or notebook that can be hanging on a hook at the exit, or placed inside the "go-bag." This should be updated at the beginning of each school year and in preparation for school drills.\n\nStudent "comfort-bags" should be requested from parents and kept in a duffle bag or backpack in homeroom classes, ready at exit. Parent-teacher association may want to assist in assembling these items, particularly for those who many not be able to afford them. Parents can also be asked to donate one blanket per child to the school, which will be kept in the emergency supplies container (see below).\n\nSchool emergency supplies should be located in a container or bin, stored outside the main school buildings. The contents should include a supply of water (approximately 4 liters of water per person per day-half drinking, half sanitation). This may be used by the school or community, if the school is utilized as a shelter. It should include communication devices, and as needed, vests and hardhats for response team members, shelter supplies, WC privacy screen, and light search and rescue supplies if needed.\n\nResponse teams will need access to several copies of your disaster response team notebook containing school and assembly area maps, master list of students, faculty/staff roster, school disaster and emergency response matrix, incident command system responsibility notes, and basic and specific emergency procedures. Teams will also need access to table, chairs, desk supplies.\n\n4. Practicing, monitoring, and improving\n\nHold simulation drills to practice, reflect upon and update your plan\n\nSchool drills should be tailored to expected hazards. Every school should conduct at least 3 fire drills per year, and at least one full simulation drill. Schools in earthquake or flood prone areas should also practice for these hazards. For every drill that you perform with a prior announcement, be sure to perform one without a prior announcement. Try them with different scenarios, at different times of the day. Try them when the school principal is there and when he or she is not there. The purpose of a drill is to prepare for the unexpected, so if you make it too easy, you won\'t learn how to adapt to the real situation. Drills should always be treated as "the real thing."\n\nGood drills are a learning process. They begin with advance preparation by staff, providing an opportunity to train students in classroom groups, remember procedures, and check on provisions. The simulation itself is an experiential learning opportunity. Following\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nthe drill, students can debrief with teachers in the classroom. An "all school" faculty and staff meeting is an important way to debrief, and to discuss ways to improve upon both mitigation measures and response preparedness. The most important part of any drill is the discussion and the updated action plan that comes from the experience.\n\nMonitoring indicators for school disaster management\n\nThe School Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist (see Addenda) is offered to guide your reflection on your own progress in implementing school disaster management policies and procedures. It is most rewarding to use this at the beginning of your efforts, to establish your "baseline", and then to repeat this check once a year to measure your progress. These can also be used during preparation for and reflection after school drills, to focus your continuing efforts to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, and assure educational continuity.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n41\n\nReferences\n\nGFDRR and INEE, Guidelines Notes on Safer School Construction, 2009. http://www.in-eesite.org/index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/\n\nInteragency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE), Minimum Standards Handbook (2010), http://www.ineesite.org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/.

Safe school buildings;\n\n2. Disaster prevention education;\n\n3. School disaster and emergency management.\n\nSafe school buildings is addressed in the GFDRR/INEE publication, Guidance Notes on Safer School Construction (2009), available in several languages: http://www.ineesite.org/ index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/ or http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=10478.\n\nIn the project development process (new construction, retrofit, and/or remodeling) many of the most critical issues related to school site selection, design for hazard-resilience, and supervised construction should have been addressed. However, the sustainability of safety, the maintenance of school facilities, and the responsibility for educational continuity, rest squarely with the administration and authorities to whom the building is handed over.\n\nDisaster prevention education is addressed in the companion publication, Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Activity Guide for K-6th Grade Teachers (IFC 2010) that provides suggested activities for introduction of basic disaster awareness and prevention at an age-appropriate level for primary school students. Integrating disaster prevention knowledge and action into students\' education at school is of critical importance to building a long-term and sustainable "culture of safety" http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13988.\n\nThe subject of this handbook, school disaster and emergency preparedness, falls in the middle (yellow) sphere below. Emergency and Disaster Preparedness: Guidance for Schools(2010) is the area that is at the core of "sustainability" of comprehensive school safety. It addresses all of those risk reduction, preparedness and response issues that must be\n\nC\n\nom prehensive School Safety\n\naddressed and implemented at the local school level, by the school community. http://www. preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13989.\n\nThere are also policy issues to be addressed by education authorities at all levels. The international Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies\' (INEE), Minimum Standards Handbook, for education in disasters, addresses emergencies from prevention through to recovery. They are designed to ensure that communities are meaningfully involved in the design and delivery of education programs in emergencies, that efforts are coordinated, accountable, and support the education sector in "building back better." http://www.ineesite. org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/. These are a companion to the SPHERE Project\'s Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response, http://www.sphereproject.org/.\n\nPolicy issues for education-sector decision-makers are also addressed in School Disaster Prevention: Guidance for Education Sector Decision-Makers (2008), http://www.preventionweb. net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=7556 .\n\nRunning through the implementation of each of these objectives are the familiar themes of community participation, coordination, and accountability. These objectives are consistent with effective approaches to any social and environmental management system and are intended to extend these principles beyond the initial project stage, throughout the life of the institution.\n\nThis approach to comprehensive school safety follows from IFC\'s performance standards for all projects, especially to those objectives related to risk reduction, safe working conditions, and community health and safety. The guidance here is intended to complement recommendations for emergency plans for response and preparedness outlined in Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines. http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/ EHSGuidelines\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nSchool Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist\n\n1.

The drill will be based on a hypothetical scenario for a likely 6.8 magnitude earthquake will roll through [your region] and affect all areas of our province. Intense shaking will begin at      [time] and will last for 45 seconds. There will be at least one strong aftershock within 15 minutes. Electrical power, water, gas and sewer systems have failed in many areas. The school\'s telephones do not work. Some highways near by are damaged and traffic is not moving. Local surface streets are also blocked. Numerous fires have started due to fallen electrical lines and explosions caused by damaged underground gas lines. We assume that there will be a state of emergency and all staff except those with prior permission are expected to remain at school. Police and Fire Departments are overwhelmed and cannot be reached. School staff must assume that they will be on their own to shelter and care for students and staff. [Note: If your school is near the coast, be sure to evacuate to higher ground, in case of tsunami]\n\nFlood drill scenario\n\n(Adapt and practice if you are in a flood plain). The drill will be based on a hypothetical scenario for a flood that occurs during the 5th day of rain, generates massive flood runoff when the river spills over its banks or floodgates are thrown open to prevent a dam burst. This is unlike anything experienced in the past 100 years. The principal has received a telephone call warning of the immanent flooding. If your building has 2 floors, your plan is to evacuate to the second floor. If your building has 1 floor, your plan is to evacuate to higher ground if time permits. Students have flotation jackets or belts for safety.\n\nHazardous materials exercise\n\n(Adapt and practice if you are located nearby production facilities that use hazardous materials). The drill will be based on a hypothetical scenario for an industrial hazardous materials release from a nearby factory. You have met with nearby industrial facilities operators and have learned the measures to take. You receive a siren. Telephone communication systems are working.\n\nD\n\nrill Scenarios\n\nOther variations\n\nTo make this a realistic simulation drill, you can add your own "injects." At the beginning and at any time during the drill you can make "new information" known, which provides challenges that participants must handle, just as they would in a real life situation.\n\nREMEMBER: every drill should be taken seriously. Every fire alarm should be responded to, as though it were real, as we do not know when it is a drill, and when it is real.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nDrill Preparedness Checklists\n\nTeacher checklist\n\nTeachers: Prepare yourselves\n\n�• School emergency evacuation route map is posted in your room.

Get to know your buddies in neighboring classes. If your name does not appear on our emergency organization matrix or if you do not have a class, please be prepared to report to the incident command center.\n\n�• Check that you know the location of your fire extinguisher and recall the acronym to remind you how to use it: P.A.S.S. Pull the pin, aim at the base of the fire, squeeze the nozzle and sweep at the base of the fire.\n\n�• It is highly recommended that you complete your own family disaster plan at home and your plan with your own childcare providers. Please prepare yourself at home and at work in the event you are needed to stay longer than your scheduled day. The principal or designee will release staff members as the needs change. If you have very extenuating circumstances discuss these with your principal NOW, not during an emergency.\n\n�• Plan a quiet activity that students can do in the assembly area in the event of a real emergency or a drill.\n\n�• In case of disaster before or soon after the end of the school day, please be prepared to return to school to provide assistance to students.\n\nTeachers: Prepare your students\n\n�• Encourage your students to take all drills very seriously.\n\n�• Practice building evacuation with your classroom and with neighboring classroom. Make sure that your students know the 4 rules for building evacuation: Don\'t Talk! Don\'t Push! Don\'t run! Don\'t turn back! Students should know that\n\nD\n\nrill Preparedness C hecklists\n\nif there is an earthquake when they are outside of a classroom (during break or lunch or if they are somewhere), they should exit with the nearest class and should NOT go back inside. If they are between classes, they should assemble in the outdoor emergency assembly area with their next period class.\n\n�• Review the emergency evacuation routes. Prepare 4 monitors who will work as buddies and lead the way, carefully checking to make sure that the route is clear. (This is of most importance for classes on second floor or without easy access to open space outdoors).\n\n�• If you face earthquake risks, practice "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" drill, having students hold their position for 45 seconds. You may count together: one-one hundred, two one-hundred etc.\n\n�• Teacher in science labs should demonstrate to students how to extinguish any flames and isolate any hazardous materials in use.\n\n�• Make sure that students understand disaster and emergency student release procedures. Inform students that only their parent(s), guardian(s), or other adult(s) listed on their emergency contacts card will be allowed to pick them up from school in a real emergency. Explain the "request gate"/"reunion gate" idea and reasons.\n\nTeachers and Students: Prepare your parents\n\n�• Teachers are to pass out drill announcements parent letters to their students to take home.\n\n�• Confirm with parents that their Emergency Contact Form is up-to-date, and explain the importance of the reunification procedures.\n\n�• Reassure parents that their children will be safe at school until they arrive.\n\nTransportation staff checklist\n\nTransportation staff: prepare yourself before an emergency.\n\n�• In the event of a major emergency, bus drivers\' first responsibility is the safety and welfare of the students. The driver will account for all students and staff throughout the emergency.\n\n�• First aid training is up-to-date.\n\n�• Emergency contact information for all students on my route is with me in my vehicle.\n\n�• Emergency medical information for students with disabilities or life-threatening illnesses is with me, in my vehicle.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nTransportation Staff: prepare your passengers.\n\n�• In areas with earthquake risk, we have practiced "Drop, Cover and Hold" and vehicle evacuation with your students.\n\n�• All passengers know that they must act in accordance with driver\'s instructions.\n\nTransportation Staff: prepare your parents and caregivers.\n\n�• Parents have been reminded that in case of emergency during the commute, I will take children to the nearest school.\n\nTransportation Staff: during earthquake shaking, I know that I will:\n\n�• Stop the bus away from power lines, bridges, overpasses, buildings, possible landslide conditions, overhanging trees, or other dangerous situations. (Beware that shaking may be mistaken for a tire blow-out) �• Instruct students to "Drop, Cover and Hold On", and take command. �• Set brake, turn off ignition, and wait for the shaking to stop.\n\nTransportation Staff: following earthquake, and in case of other hazards, I know that I will: �• Check for and attend to injuries. Report and record injuries.\n\n�• Evacuate the bus in the event of a fire.\n\n�• Not attempt to cross any damaged bridges or overpasses or drive through any flooded streets or roads.\n\n�• Use radio to notify Transportation Dispatch of your location and receive instructions if possible.\n\n�• If it is safe to continue, proceed by vehicle or on foot to the nearest school.\n\n�• Notify school site incident commander and provide them with students\' emergency contact and emergency medical information.\n\n�• Remain with the children until further instructions are provided from the incident commander or Transportation Dispatch.\n\nTransportation Staff: protecting students in case of disaster or emergency\n\n�• I understand that I may release students only to:\n\n• Parents or guardians or those listed on Emergency Contact List, who properly identify themselves (retain copy of Student/Family Reunification Form).\n\n• Medical care facility providers (document status and destination).\n\n• School principal, site manager, teacher, or transportation official.\n\n• Public safety authorities.\n\n�• I understand that I may need to improvise and make independent decisions, depending on the emergencies, age of children, location of bus and so forth.\n\nD\n\nrill Preparedness C hecklists\n\nClass Status Report Form\n\nReturn this form to the assembly area collecting point, immediately after evacuation.\n\nResponsible teacher/staff name:__________________________ room __________ Alternate responsible person:________________________ Yes ____ No _____\n\nAll Persons Accounted for: [ ] Yes [ ] No\n\nMissing or Unaccounted for: Last seen:\n\nInjured persons: Where now:\n\nAbsent / Left early / Sent elsewhere?

Worldwide, 450 cities with populations over 1 million face recurring earthquakes. Cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes are among the deadliest and costliest of disasters. Droughts and desertification currently affect 250 million people and threaten 1.2 billion people in 110 countries (UNESCO, 2007). Annually recurring floods regularly prevent millions of children from attending a full year of school. </p><p>Education is a human right, universal and inalienable. Education is especially important in enabling people to reach their full potential and exercise other rights. This right does not disappear or get suspended because of disasters and emergencies. When education is interrupted or limited, students drop out, with negative and permanent economic and social impacts for students, their families, and their communities. Natural hazards are part of the context for educational planning. Whether it is annually recurring floods, a once-in-5-generations earthquake, the increasing severity of storms and cyclones, water shortages, or the slow onset of rising sea water levels, these known and expected hazards can be mitigated with the determined application of knowledge, education, and ingenuity. </p><p>We are not able to prevent the earth from shaking, the wind from blowing, or the rain from falling. However, with assessment and planning, physical and environmental protection and response preparedness we can prevent these events from becoming disasters. Since schools are our universal institution for sharing knowledge and skills, the expectations for schools to be role models in disaster prevention is high. Successful disaster mitigation is one of the ultimate tests of the success of the education we provide over generations. </p><p>This <i>Handbook </i>is written for administrators, teachers, support staff, and other individuals involved in emergency and disaster preparedness atschool. Its purposes are:\n</p><p>• To guide administrators and staff in assessing risks and planning and carrying out physical protection measures; </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• To develop skills and provisions for disaster and emergency preparedness, response, and rapid recovery;\n</p><p>• To support schools in developing disaster and emergency plans specific to their local needs and reflecting good practices internationally and nationally.\n</p><p>This handbook has been prepared with a primary focus on \'school safety\' and thus the language used throughout refers to \'schools\' versus \'universities\'. However, the underlying tenets in terms of the development of policy, planning and implementation is equally relevant regardless of the type of institution in question.\n</p><p> 3 </p><h2><p>School Disaster Management\n</p></h2><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b><i> School Disaster Management</i></b> is the process of assessment and planning, physical protection and response capacity development designed to: </p><p>1. Protect students and the staff from physical harm;\n</p><p>2. Minimize disruption and ensure the continuity of education for all children; 3. Develop and maintain a culture of safety.\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>School safety and educational continuity require a dynamic, continuous process ini-tiated by management and involving workers, students, parents, and the local com-munity. School disaster management involves the familiar cycle of steps found in all project management: <i>assess </i>hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities and resources; <i>plan and implement </i>for physical risk reduction, maintenance of safe facilities, standard operating procedures and training for disaster response; <i>test</i> mitigation and preparedness plans and skills regularly, with realistic simulation drills; and <i>revise</i> your plan based on your experience. </p><p>School disaster management mirrors individual and family disaster prevention, and wider community disaster prevention efforts. This guidance document is organized to help remember and observe the parallel processes for disaster prevention that are taken up at every level of society. The full scope of activities is included as follows:\n</p><p>1. <b>Assessment and planning </b>- establishing or empowering your school disaster management committee; assessing your risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities; making contingency plans for educational continuity; communicating your plan. 2. <b>Physical and environmental protection </b>- structural safety maintenance, nonstructural mitigation; local infrastructure and environmental mitigation; fire safety.\n</p><p>3. <b>Response capacity development </b>- standard operating procedures; response skills and organization; response provisions.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>4. <b>Practicing, monitoring, and improving </b>- holding simulation drills to practice, reflect upon and update your plan; monitoring indicators for school disaster management.\n</p><p>Comprehensive School Safety Schema\n</p><p>GOALS:\n</p><p>Student &amp; Staff Protection\n</p><p>Ob\n</p><p>ject\n</p><p>ive\n</p><p>s:\n</p><p>Ind\n</p><p>icat\n</p><p>ors\n</p><p>Educational Continuity\n</p><p>School Disaster Management\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>Culture of Safety\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>• Representative SDM Committee\n</p><p>• Assessment &amp; Planning\n</p><p>• Physical Protection\n</p><p>• Response Skills &amp; Provisions\n</p><p>• Educational Continuity Plan\n</p><p>• Policies &amp; Procedures\n</p><p>• Staff Development\n</p><p>Safe School Buildings\n</p><p>• Safe Site Selection\n</p><p>• Building Codes\n</p><p>• Performance Standards\n</p><p>• Disaster Resilient Design\n</p><p>• Builder Training\n</p><p>• Construction Supervision\n</p><p>• Quality Control\n</p><p>• Retrofit\n</p><p>• Remodeling\n</p><p>Disaster Prevention Education\n</p><p>• Extracurricular &amp; Community-based Informal Education\n</p><p>• Formal Curriculum Integration &amp; Infusion\n</p><p>• Teacher Training\n</p><p>• Building Maintenance\n</p><p> • Non-Structural Mitigation\n</p><p> • Fire Safety\n</p><p>• Structural\nSafety\nEducation\n</p><p>• Construction\nas Education\nOpportunity\n</p><p>• Family Disaster Plan\n</p><p>• Family Reunification\n</p><p>• School Drills\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p><b>1. Assessment and planning\n</b></p><p>Assessment and planning is the starting point for all thoughtful mitigation and safety efforts. For without assessment, planning is arbitrary and without planning, assessment has no purpose. The steps below can be accomplished in a matter of days.\n</p><p><b><i>Establish or empower your school disaster and emergency management committee\n</i></b></p><p>School safety is the job of the entire school community. This effort requires leadership and coordination by school administration, and involvement and participation from all sectors of the school community.\n</p><p>Each school should establish and maintain an ongoing School Disaster Management Committee (also called a School Safety Committee, or School Disaster and Emergency Management Committee) to oversee disaster risk reduction and preparedness. This may be the job of a pre-existing committee, sub-committee with a similar mission, or one newly established for this purpose. This committee develops, adapts, implements, and updates the school disaster management plan. It will typically meet intensively at the beginning of each school year and monthly during the school year. It will encourage personal and organizational preparedness, guide mitigation work, assure two fire and building evacuation drills annually, lead one full simulation drill annually, evaluate the results, and adjust the plan accordingly. Ideally, the committee is empowered by and maintains formal links between school and disaster management authorities. </p><p>School Disaster Management Committee members need strong leadership (ideally the school principal or assistant principal). The committee is most effective when it involves <i>representatives</i> of all major stakeholder groups, such as those listed below:\n</p><p>• School administration; </p><p>• Teachers - larger schools should make sure that all major departments or sections of school faculty and staff are represented;\n</p><p>• Staff - this includes facilities, maintenance, nutrition, security, health, counseling, transportation etc.\n</p><p>• Parents - this should be linked to the parent-teacher association or similar school welfare committee; </p><p>• School neighbors - this includes neighborhood civic association, large businesses, and public safety officials.

Every small step is important in reaching the goals of safety and educational continuity. The committee might start by creating a calendar of activities to develop awareness and build momentum throughout the school year. Major milestones include:\n</p><p>• Form or re-form committee; </p><p>• Distribute Family Disaster Plan forms to staff, students and families; </p><p>• Complete School Hazard Impact Assessment;Identify vulnerabilities and capacities; </p><p>• Prioritize mitigation activities; </p><p>• Develop staff training plan; </p><p>• Review basic emergency and standard operating procedures;\n</p><p>• Conduct school and neighborhood hazard hunt; </p><p>• Check <i>School Evacuation Route Maps</i> posted in each classroom and corridor; </p><p>• Check fire suppression equipment; </p><p>• Identify campus and neighborhood risks, and resources on maps;\n</p><p>• Post neighborhood and school campus maps prominently; </p><p>• Check and re-supply administration, nursing office, and classroom <i>Go-Bags</i>; </p><p>• Request student comfort kits from families; </p><p>• Check and re-supply first aid kits and emergency supplies; </p><p>• Communicate student-family reunification procedures to parents; </p><p>• Update student emergency release permissions; </p><p>• Schedule fire drill and full simulation drills; </p><p>• Practice drills with each class; </p><p>• Minimum of two annual fire and building evacuation drills; </p><p>• Implement full simulation drill for other hazards. </p><p>• Evaluate drill and revise plans and procedures. </p><p>It is a good idea to have one large <i>school safety bulletin board</i> in a prominent location, which the committee can use to share information and to create and maintain disaster pre-\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>vention awareness in the school community. It is particularly important for the committee to remember that students of all ages <i>can</i> and <i>should</i> be involved, as much as possible and as appropriate, in all aspects of school disaster prevention. This learning experience will contribute to a culture of safety for future generations. Students can be involved as rotating classroom representatives, student government volunteers, scout volunteers, and through extra-curricular activities.\n</p><p>A School Disaster Plan is always a work-in-progress, and never a finished document. Successful plans emphasize planning as a process, rather than a neatly bound document. In the course of the steps below, you will generate and re-generate live documentation that will constitute your "plan." What is of crucial importance is having everyone participate in the planning, and learning and continuing to develop the plan through practice.\n</p><p><b><i>Assess risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities\n</i></b></p><p>Risks are assessed by considering potential hazards (whether these are natural, man-made, or combined), in relationship to a community\'s vulnerability characteristics (i.e., the circumstances that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard. Vulnerabilities apply to groups of people and to individuals, to the built environment and infrastructure, and to the natural environment. For example, young children, older adults, people with disabilities, poor people, minority language groups, recent immigrants, and illiterate people tend to be more vulnerable. Buildings not constructed to withstand hazards are vulnerable. Coastlines unprotected by coral reefs and mangrove forests are vulnerable to high winds. Marine life is vulnerable to oil spills, and so on.\n</p><p>The steps below will guide you to document the hazards you face, the vulnerability characteristics of people and places, and the resulting risks. Constructing your own risk matrix can help to see the larger picture, and focus and prioritize your efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and risks.

Identify all of the hazards that your school community may face. These may be of "natural" and/or "man-made" origin.\n</p><p>B. Discuss how likely these hazards are. In the case of earthquake, flood, volcano, landslide and similar, check with scientific and technical or disaster management authorities to be sure that you have an accurate understanding of these likelihoods. Some hazards are ever-present, some seasonal, some increase, and some are infrequent but inevitable. Rate the likelihood on a scale of 1 to 5. You should be planning for what may happen sometime during your school career, or your children and grandchildren\'s school years.\n</p><p>HAZARDS 1 2 3 4 5\n</p><p>Likelihood Very low Low Medium High Very high\n</p><p>C. Rate the impact severity for each of these hazards on a scale of 1 to 5.

The location, design and construction of a building can increase or decrease your school\'s vulnerability in the case of fire, earthquake, flood, landslide, snow or windstorm, extreme temperature, volcanic hazards, or bomb threats. </p><p>If you have identified these hazards as priorities, ideally you will already have taken structural safety measures in the course of school site selection and school construction, retrofit or remodeling. Note that for IFC projects, structural engineers and architects responsible for facilities, buildings, plants and structures should certify the applicability and appropriateness of the design criteria employed (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.81). </p><p>The <i>School Building Safety Checklist</i> in the Addenda will help you to identify any issues that would benefit from a closer look. This includes:\n</p><p>• Location and soil; </p><p>• Load carrying system;\n</p><p>• Building height;\n</p><p>• Design;\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• Construction detailing;\n</p><p>• Water damage.\n</p><p>Identify any structural safety concerns that may require further investigation. You may need the support of a qualified engineer or architect to undertake this assessment with you. If any of these conditions apply to your buildings, you will need to investigate further with professional engineering help. As warranted by engineering investigation, develop a strategy for mitigating structural deficiencies through retrofitting or during ongoing remodeling.\n</p><p><b>Assessing non-structural safety\n</b></p><p>If you have prioritized fire, earthquake, flood, and windstorms you will need to take a step further to assess non-structural risks associated with your buildings. This will help to identify those measures that can be taken to make classrooms, offices, and common spaces safer. The review team should include users of each space as well as facilities maintenance staff. Use your imagination and common sense as you go from room to room, and around the building.\n</p><p><b>Fire prevention and fire safety</b> measures are part of your initial school design, and also require regular maintenance and testing. Assess to be sure that: </p><p>• Flammable and hazardous materials sources are limited, isolated, eliminated, or secured. This includes electrical lines and appliances, heaters and stoves, natural gas pipes and LPG canisters, flammable or combustible liquids;\n</p><p>• Exit routes are clear to facilitate safe evacuation in case of fire or other emergency;\n</p><p>• Detection and alarm systems are working;\n</p><p>• Fire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n</p><p>• Other fire suppression and control equipment is regularly tested and maintained;\n</p><p>• Mechanical, electrical, and civil structures and systems are maintained and operable, in compliance with life and fire safety design criteria (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.80).\n</p><p>For <b>cyclone/high winds safety</b> think about objects that can be torn away, fly away or be battered by wind outside. Note what can be done, and who should do it. </p><p>For <b>earthquake safety</b> think about objects that may slide, fall, or fly, and especially anything that can cause injury or block exits. Note what can be done, who should do it, and when it should be completed. </p><p>Prioritize the items as follows:\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• Priority 1: <b>secure items that can kill or injure or block exits </b>(e.g., heavy equipment, heating/cooling units, pipes, storage tanks, overhead lighting, bookshelves, hazardous chemicals, things blocking exits). Note that <i>all </i>exit doors should open outwards.\n</p><p>• Priority 2: <b>secure things can cause significant economic or cultural loss, cause injury, or impair educational continuity </b>(e.g., computers, audio-visual equipment, school awards, and breakables).\n</p><p>• Priority 3: <b>secure things that, if damaged, can impede recovery.</b> </p><p><b>Assessing capacities and resources for mitigation, response and recovery\n</b></p><p>Your school community also has many strengths, capacities and resources that need to be identified and mobilized. As you read through this guide you will develop a good grasp of some of the physical protection measures, as well as response and recovery skills and resources that you will need. Make a list of all of these needs. Then, in your school community, identify the people and places with the knowledge, skills, and provisions you need, and find out how you can activate that capacity to reduce your risks and speed your recovery. Identify resources and problem-solve to fill the gaps. Include name, skills/resources, location and contact information. </p><p>In terms of knowledge and skills for risk reduction, think about: structural engineers, environmental engineers, safety experts, facilities staff, handymen, plumbers, electricians, builders. For response and recovery, think about: emergency management experts, health professionals, volunteer groups, scouts, women, organizing volunteers, obtaining supplies, communication experts, shelter construction, and supplies management. Find out what response skills your staff and students already have. Use this assessment to plan for needed training to fill the gaps.\n</p><p>Finally, consider the provisions you will need for response and recovery. As a rule of thumb, collectively as a community you should plan to be able to take care of yourselves for seven days. Between home, school, and work everyone will need four liters of water per person/per day, high energy food. As a school community you will be expected to provide leadership in this. Planning for shelter and sanitation and a site for stockpiling communal supplies are all reasonable expectations from schools.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b><i> Creative problem solving to bridge the gap between needs and resources</i></b>: in one university, a single supplier delivers drinking water to many buildings and departments, but none had extra supplies.

Review and revise these maps as you develop and revise your disaster prevention plan. </p><p><b><i>Contingency planning for educational continuity </i></b></p><p>When students are out-of-school for any prolonged period of time, drop-out rates increase, resulting in lifelong negative impacts. Staff unemployment also follows. In addition to all of the steps taken for hazard and resource assessment, physical protection, and response capacity development, you will also need to have contingency plans for how to continue providing education to students as quickly as possible following hazard impact. This is especially true for schools that face recurring hazards such as annual floods. Alternate sites, temporary shelters, delivery of homework packets, radio and television delivery of lessons are just some of the creative alternatives for making sure that education continues. In the post-disaster period, students will also need to participate in recovery efforts, and have time set aside for a variety of psychosocial support activities, and opportunities for communal grief recovery, to ease their adjustment to the sudden losses in their lives. This may include people, homes, jobs, communities and tangible cultural heritage.\n</p><p>Your school, if in good condition, may also be called upon to be used as an emergency shelter, further disrupting education. If you use private services for security, catering and transportation, these companies should be included in your planning process. Have memoranda of understanding ahead of time with engineers who can inspect your building for safety, water pumping equipment providers, and various other contingency steps can be taken in advance and speed your recovery.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p><b><i>Communicating your plan\n</i></b></p><p>School faculty and staff, students, parents, and local community leaders and first responders all need to be familiar with your plans, in order for them to work effectively. Community members have a great deal to offer the school disaster management process, supporting in risk reduction activities, participating in school drills, volunteering during response and recovery, and providing response supplies.\n</p><p>You may want to hold special meetings with local public safety representatives, and an open meeting for your entire school community to communicate your plans and invite participation and support. Communicate this information in as many ways as possible (written, audio, visual, demonstration, and through younger students). Translate as necessary to include everyone. </p><p>Staff need to understand your expectations of them. If a disaster occurs, when are they expected to report to work? How they will organize shifts? Which individuals may not be able to stay because young children or elderly family members are at home. Open discussion and realistic planning will help. Everyone will want to know what notification systems you will be using (telephone tree, posted notice on building, radio, automated phone messages, e-mail, school web-page). </p><p>Parents need to be knowledgeable and involved. It is essential for disaster preparedness that parents know and trust that their children will be safe and cared for at school, until the danger has passed or outside help arrives, even for two to three days! Let them know, <i>in advance,</i> all emergency procedures. </p><p>Clearly explain student release procedures to parents, students and community members. Students will be released only to parent/guardian or other pre-authorized emergency contact (who should bring photo identification with them). Provide information about alternate evacuation and reunification site, especially if your school grounds are not likely to be safe because of nearby hazards. Explain that in case of a lockdown, the school will not be able to answer incoming phone calls or make outside calls. Police will provide assistance. No one, including parents, will be allowed near the school. Students will be kept inside and not permitted to leave until the lockdown is lifted by the police. After that, parents may come to school to pick up their children.\n</p><p>As part of this communication process, you should ask parents to provide:<i> </i></p><p>• <i>Emergency contact information: </i>in order to implement student release procedures, be sure that parent and emergency contact information is updated at the beginning of each school year and that parents notify the school of changes during the school year. </p><p>• <i>Student comfort bags:</i> these hold essential supplies each child in case of emergency (see Section 3.C below).\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>And last but not least, students will be empowered participants in disaster prevention, now and in the future, if they are fully and thoughtfully included in communicating school safety plans.\n</p><p><b>2. Physical and environmental protection\n</b></p><p>Your plan to reduce vulnerability and risks will need to consider:\n</p><p>• <b><i>Structural safety</i></b> - this addresses the safety of buildings on or near the school site;\n</p><p>• <b><i>Non-structural safety</i></b> - this addresses the threats posed by building furnishings and equipment as well as building elements such as roofs, windows, stairs, heating and cooling systems, water storage, pipes, and exit routes. This includes fire safety;\n</p><p>• <b><i>Local infrastructure</i></b> - this addresses lifeline utilities such as water, electricity, gas, as well as communications and transportation conduits. It also covers transportation safety;\n</p><p>• <b><i>Environmental mitigation </i></b>- this addresses ambient conditions such as temperature, inundation, hazardous materials release, and climate change impacts.\n</p><p>The dos and don\'ts below will assist in identifying and implementing these protection measures. </p><p><b><i>Structural safety maintenance\n</i></b></p><p>While implementation of structural safety measures is beyond the scope of this document, building maintenance is a critical component in the maintenance of structural and nonstructural safety. Damage should be repaired as discovered, and structural safety should not be compromised through alteration and misuse. Responsibility for this rests with local school administration and designated facilities and maintenance personnel.\n</p><p>Check to be sure that you:\n</p><p>• Do not compromise columns or beams by cutting, exposing, or making holes in them; </p><p>• Do not let reinforcing steel be exposed to air or moisture; </p><p>• Do cover exposed steel with concrete mortar; </p><p>• Fix wood rot, cracked mortar, cracked bricks, and concrete damage; </p><p>• Keep gutters and drainage systems clear of debris;\n</p><p>• Make sure that water and moisture drains away from building; </p><p>• Replace broken glass.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p><b><i>Non-structural safety\n</i></b></p><p>Non-structural safety measures are those that are not connected with the weight-bearing system of the building, and those that are in the hands of users. This includes fire prevention and readily available fire suppression equipment. Special attention is required to make sure that all building occupants can safely exit in case building evacuation is necessary. In case of earthquake and storms, the main considerations are injury prevention both within and immediately outside buildings.\n</p><p>Do check that: </p><p>• All classroom doors, doors of high-occupancy rooms, and doors to outside open outwards;\n</p><p>• Exit pathways are kept clear;\n</p><p>• Non-structural building elements are securely fastened to the building to resist wind or earthquake </p><p>• shaking; </p><p>• Fire suppression equipment is located appropriately and maintained in good working condition;\n</p><p>• Flammable and combustible materials are limited, isolated, eliminated, and separated, away from • dangerous interactions and heat sources;\n</p><p>• Electrical systems are maintained and are not overloaded; </p><p>• Classrooms have two exits wherever possible. (Sometimes the second exit is a window.)\n</p><p>If you face earthquakes and windstorms:\n</p><p>• Move heavy items below head level;\n</p><p>• Tightly secure tall and heavy furniture and appliance to walls, floors and ceilings. (e.g., use L-brackets to walls or spring-loaded adjustable tension rods to ceiling or wedges under bottom front, or strip barrier fastened to tabletop, as appropriate);\n</p><p>• Fasten cabinet doors and drawers with latches that will hold shut during shaking; Secure heaters and cooling systems suspended inside or outside of building; </p><p>• Fasten liquid propane gas tanks, fire extinguishers and other gas cylinders to the wall;\n</p><p>• Protect from glass that may break into large shards (e.g., rearrange furniture, use window film, curtains, or install strengthened glass.);\n</p><p>• Secure heavy and important electronic items to table top or floor using straps and </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• Secure lighting fixtures to ceiling;\n</p><p>• Fasten pictures on closed hooks; </p><p>• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials.\n</p><p>And for floods:\n</p><p>• Raise important items above possible flood level;\n</p><p>• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials above flood level.\n</p><p><b><i>Local infrastructure safety\n</i></b></p><p>Local infrastructure includes the water, electricity, gas, heating and cooling systems, communications and transportation systems in your area. These are usually part of larger systems maintained by government and private agencies. Careful design and problem-solving with these organizations, ahead of time, can protect students and educational assets, and make these systems resilient. Depending on the hazards faced, a wide variety of solutions can be considered:\n</p><p>• Relocate overhead wires and poles that may block exit routes;\n</p><p>• Install automatic natural gas shut off valves at building level;\n</p><p>• Use flexible connectors for pipes;\n</p><p>• Consider dangers posed by overhead and underground pipes and depots;\n</p><p>• Replace radioactive lightening rods with those that do not pose health risk.\n</p><p>Transportation safety may involve road and pedestrian crossing conditions as well as operations of school or contractor buses or minivans. On an annual basis, worldwide, transportation accidents are the leading cause of student deaths and injuries. Clear lines of sight and signage, stop signs, traffic lights, clearly marked pedestrian crosswalks, and crossing-guards at busy crossings are all important safety measures. Vehicle safety, driver testing and training, and installation, maintenance, and use of seat belts, and careful routing are all of importance in ensuring that students are safe in school transport. Once on school transportation, rules of access and conduct, and adult supervision are also important factors. </p><p><b><i>Environmental safety\n</i></b></p><p>Environmental safety issues bring schools into focus in their local environments.

Response capacity development\n</b></p><p>The final piece of the puzzle involves the development of response capacity. This includes the systematic organization of response, standard response skills (including basic emergency procedures and procedures for specific hazards), and accessing provisions during an emergency. <b>Details on each follows.\n</b></p><p><b><i>Response organization using Incident Command Systems (ICS) </i></b></p><p>Response capacity involves knowledge, procedures, skills, and provisions. The most important aspect of response capacity is organization and mobilization of existing skills and resources. A standard emergency management system, such as<i> Incident Command Systems (ICS) </i>shown in the diagram at the bottom of this section, can be used as a guiding framework for coordinating the many standard functions that may be called for in different emergency situations.\n</p><p><b>Incident command systems </b></p><p>The purpose of ICS is to ensure that the <i>most help</i> reaches the <i>most people</i>, and to provide a consistent system that staff, students, and emergency personnel can apply in any school, anywhere. Key principles are:\n</p><p><b>Conditions Solutions to explore\n</b></p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Extreme weather during school year </p></td><td><p>school design, alternate locations, alternate delivery methods\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Landslide tree-planting, slope stabilization, retaining wall, evacuation routes\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Forest fires </p></td><td><p>fire breaks\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Tsunami evacuation routes, stairs, ladder\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Drought / Food insecurity </p></td><td><p>rainwater harvesting, school gardens, tree planting, food storage\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Solid waste management recycling point\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Water and energy shortage and costs </p></td><td><p>water and energy conservation\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Hazardous materials production or storage\n</p><p>community "right-to-know", regular review of safety measures, facility tours and dialogues\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Air pollution </p></td><td><p>walking and bicycling to school, car-pooling\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• Standardization - the use of common terminology (and no codes);\n</p><p>• Unified chain of command in order to assign resources for maximum effectiveness;\n</p><p>• Flexible, modular organization, mobilized as needed; and\n</p><p>• Integrated communications.\n</p><p>There are five key functions in ICS are that can be mobilized as needed in the particular circumstances. These five functions form a common approach to organize response to any emergency or disaster. Depending on the number of staff and trusted volunteers or capable older-students available, some people may need to have multiple roles.\n</p><p>• <b>Incident command: </b>these are<b> decision-makers </b>(responsible for/set mission)\n Although someone in your school may be designated as <b>"</b>Emergency Manager<b>"</b> under normal circumstances, in case of actual disaster or emergency, the <b>"</b>Incident Commander<b>"</b> is the first capable person on the scene, until that function can be transferred to a more qualified person or higher authority. Even if normally that person is a Principal or Assitant Principal, several different people should practice in this role, as those indiviuals may or may not be available during an actual emergency or disaster. The <b>"</b>Incident Commander<b>"</b> mobilizes the on-site "Incident Command Center.<b>"\n</b></p><p>• <b>Communications team: </b>these are<b> communicators </b>(listeners and talkers)\n</p><p>  The communications team is the right arm of the Incident Commander, establishing connections with education administration, public safety, and emergency management authorities, and with parents and the public, as directed. When communications systems are operational some information can be disseminated using telephone trees, and radio announcements. In large-scale disasters the key communications are with students (often by the school principal or assistant principal, using a megaphone to communicate) and with parents anticipating reunification with students. </p><p>• <b>Operations branch: </b>these are<b> doers </b>(carry out the mission)<b> </b></p><p>  This branch requires a highly organized and well-respected Operations Chief, who manages teams to fulfill: light search and rescue, fire suppression and hazardous materials control, utility shut-off, disaster first aid, psychosocial support, security, and student release/family reunification functions.\n</p><p>• <b>Logistics branch</b>: these are<b> getters/supporters </b>(support the mission) </p><p>  This branch requires a Logistics Chief, who knows the site and its resources best. These teams will find and distribute supplies and provisions, shelter and sanitation, water and nutrition, and organize volunteer recruitment and assignment.\n</p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>• <b>Information and planning: </b>these are<b> documenters and analyzers </b>(support the mission) </p><p>  This branch is typically mobilized in advance of a disaster, identifying and researching resources, executing memoranda of understanding in advance. During an incident it documents the situation, activities, and assures accurate record keeping.\n</p><p>• <b>Finance/administrators: </b>these are<b> payers </b>(pay and negotiate)<b> </b></p><p>  This function typically keeps records of resources and staff time expended during any emergency, arranging compensation where permitted, and negotiating as needed for access to needed resources.\n</p><p>ICS is a flexible system that can be activated to different levels, depending on the situation. For example, an intruder on campus, a fight between students, or traffic accident might be handled by activating Level I alone. A small fire or flood might require Level II activation. A major disaster, such as an earthquake might require full activation of multiple teams at Level III. Maintaining this structure allows more responders to be integrated, maintaining the chain of command, and a manageable span of control (i.e., 5-8 people per supervisor). It is <i>not</i> normally recommended to have permanent teams with single functions because each situation differs, and may call for more or fewer people on any particular team. As much as resources permit, staff should cross-train. Even if response teams are formed ahead of time, staff should understand and be prepared to assume any response role, as needed. Incident Command Systems are designed to be flexible, and to activate from the top down, only to the level, and only those functions required by the particular disaster or emergency. </p><p><b><i>Standard operating procedures\n</i></b></p><p>Standard emergency response procedures depend on the hazard, and can and should be customized to your unique circumstances. These are built around six basic emergency procedures detailed below:\n</p><p>• Building evacuation;\n</p><p>• Shelter-in-place;\n</p><p>• Lockdown;\n</p><p>• Assemble and shelter outside;\n</p><p>• Evacuate to safe haven;\n</p><p>• Emergency student release/family reunification.\n</p><p>Each of the procedures is described in detail below. Remember that individuals with disabilities, foreign language speakers and visitors unfamiliar with these procedures may </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>need assistance in following them. The<i> Emergency Procedures Decision-Tree</i> that follows illustrates the different circumstances that lead to these six basic procedures. </p><p><b>Question #1</b>-<b>Is there any warning before the hazard impact?</b> Is the hazard rapid-onset, without warning (such as acts of violence, earthquake, fire), or is it a slow or medium-onset hazard with some early warning (such as floods, cyclone, winter storms, etc.)? In the case of medium onset events with early warning, school maybe closed, and alternate education </p><p>Incident Command Systems Organigram\n</p><p>School Safety/School Disaster &amp; Emergency Management Committee\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Safety Officer\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Operations\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Damage Assessment Light Search &amp; Rescue\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fire Suppression\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>First Aid\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Psychosocial Support\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Student Supervision\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Student Release\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Equipment &amp; Supplies\n</p><p>Volunteering &amp; Staffing\n</p><p>Transportation &amp; Traffic\n</p><p>Shelter &amp; Sanitation\n</p><p>Water &amp; Food\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td><p>Planning, Analysis\n</p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><p>&amp; Finance\n</p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td><p>Documentation\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Procurement\n</p><p>Logistics\n</p><p>Administration, Finance &amp; Documentation\n</p><p>Management/ Commander\n</p><p>Communications Team\n</p><p>Liaison Officer\n</p><p>Public Information Officer\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Level I\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Level II\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p>Level III\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>delivery methods set into motion. In this case, normal student-release procedures would be applied. In some situations, schools may be the shelter-of-choice for the local community. In the case of violence (person with weapon, terrorist activity) administration should announce a lockdown<b>. </b></p><p><b>Question #2</b>-<b>Is the building safe?</b> The second question is whether the building is safe. If the building is unsafe then <b><i>building evacuation</i></b> should be immediately triggered. In the case of rapid onset hazards such as fire and earthquake, the building must be assumed to be unsafe, and therefore cautious building evacuation should be automatically triggered. (Note that during earthquake shaking, everyone should<i> "drop, cover and hold on</i>" and that evacuation should only begin once the shaking has stopped.) In other situations a rapid assessment can be made before evacuation. If the building is safe then the students and staff should be instructed to <b><i>shelter-in-place</i></b>. <i>Reverse evacuation</i> is practiced for orderly return from assembly area back into classrooms, to shelter-in-place.\n</p><p><b>Question #3</b>-<b>Are the school grounds are safe?</b> If school grounds are safe then <b><i>assemble and shelter outside</i></b> is the procedure. If school grounds are known to be unsafe (e.g., in coastal area with tsunami risk) then automatic <b><i>evacuation to safe haven</i></b> should take place. A rapid assessment (e.g., of hazardous materials, fallen power lines, pipeline ruptures) will help decide between these two options.\n</p><p>In all cases, following assembly, reassessment should take place periodically and one of these actions maintained. In the case of real disasters and emergencies incidents, <b><i>emergency student release</i></b> procedures should be initiated, ensuring that students are returned directly and only to the care of parents/guardians or their pre-designated emergency contacts, and each reunion documented. Students should remain cared for and supervised until the last student is reunited and the <i>All Clear</i> is given by the incident commander (explained in the next section). In the case of drills and small events a <i>reverse evacuation </i>may be practiced to return to class, prior to<i> </i>"<i>All Clear</i>" instruction and resumption of classes. </p><p><b>Building evacuation, evacuation to safe haven and assembly procedure\n</b></p><p><b>Administration:</b> sounds fire alarm; makes announcement to students and staff. In case of fire, close doors and windows. In case of hazardous materials, close ventilation system. Activate Incident Command System as appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Maintain communication. Announce any new procedure. Announce "<i>All Clear</i>" when emergency has ended.\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p><b>Staff: </b><i>ahead of time, p</i>ractice as a class, following both fire and earthquake procedures. Identify any students or staff who may need special assistance during evacuation. Learn from these individuals how best to help them. Teach students how to provide assistance ahead of time. In schools with large numbers of disabled students needing assistance, volunteers should be recruited from the immediate vicinity and trained. Be prepared to help visitors as well.\n</p><p><i>At time of alarm or after earthquake shaking stops:</i> </p><p>1. Remind students to follow instructions for building evacuation: "Don\'t Talk. Don\'t Push. Don\'t Run. Don\'t Turn Back." Students should exit with buddies in twos. Check that students or staff needing special assistance have it. Remind students <i>NOT</i> to use cell phones, to keep lines free for emergency communications! </p><p>2. Take your:\n</p><p>• Classroom <i>Go-Bag or Go-Bucket;\n</i></p><p>• <i>Emergency clipboard or notebook</i> with class lists and <i>Class Status Report Forms (See Addenda);\n</i></p><p>• Duffle bag packed with <i>student comfort bags. </i></p><p>3. Use the buddy system. Take a few seconds to check briefly with the teacher in the classroom to the left, to the right, and across the hall to see if they are in need. Unless instructed otherwise, evacuate using normal building evacuation routes posted. If you encounter obstructions, such as jammed door, be prepared to take an alternate route. One teacher should be in the front to check that the evacuation route is clear. One responsible student monitor should be immediately behind the teacher, keeping students quiet and orderly. One teacher and responsible student monitor should be at the rear of the group, seeing that everyone is together. Move directly away from the building when exiting. Designated teachers from each wing should check washrooms as they exit.\n</p><p>4. Take your seat in the emergency assembly area (normally, organized by first period or homeroom class). Keep classes separate and take roll. Check again for injuries. If any students are injured, send them with two buddies to the First Aid station, with instructions to return together immediately. For large schools, mount your classroom identification sign at front of group above head level. Fill out your <i>Classroom Status Report Form</i> and return it to Incident Command Center with student runner.\n</p><p>5. Remind students about student-release procedures and their purpose to keep them safe. Remind them <i>not</i> to use their cell phones in order to keep lines open for emergency. For emergency communication, use SMS only. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class). </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>6. If you are a member of the Search and Rescue, First Aid Team or Fire Suppression Team, have the teacher next to you supervise your class and proceed to the Incident Command Center. </p><p>7. Teachers are to remain with their class <b>AT ALL TIMES</b>. <b>Students must remain seated together as a class.</b> Periodically call roll as needed. Keep students quiet so that they can hear information from the public address or megaphone/bullhorn system that will be used for announcements. Children are to leave only in the company of reunion gate messengers. The Incident Command Center will provide updates and relieve staff of their assignments.\n</p><p>Note: all personnel without a specific duty or class are to immediately report to the Incident Command Center for instructions. All teaching assistants and campus aides who do not have a class are to report immediately to the assembly area to assist with the supervision of students. </p><p><b>Evacuation to safe haven:</b> all schools should designate an alternate site for assembly should school grounds need to be evacuated. Identify evacuation routes ahead of time, and inform parents of this alternate site. Schools that face known risks such as flooding, landslide, debris flow, tsunami, chemical release, or schools that do not have a safe assembly area on-site, should arrange and prepare safe havens ahead of time with emergency supplies. If necessary, also arrange transportation to your safe haven depending on the threats you face, evacuation to safe haven may be automatic (e.g., following earthquake in coastal areas with tsunami threat), or you may wait for evaluation by on-site incident commander and assessment team. </p><p><b>Reverse evacuation:</b> there may also be times when it becomes necessary to <i>go back inside</i>, because <i>inside</i> is safer than outside. Practice <i>reverse evacuation </i>at the end of your drills, when you go back to your classrooms, following all of the same rules.\n</p><p><b>N.B. Always assume and act as though an alarm is signaling a real threat.</b><i> </i>Whether an alarm is a real situation, a drill, or even a false alarm, safety demands that you practice your response procedures as though it were real event!\n</p><p><b>Shelter in place procedure\n</b></p><p>You may be requested to shelter-in-place when there are dangers outside the school that prevent normal student release, such as severe weather or flooding, nuclear, biological or chemical incident or terrorist attack. Shelter-in-place is appropriate when evacuation is not </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>necessary, or when there is not time to evacuate. It should be announced throughout the school using a public address system or face-to-face communication.\n</p><p><b>Administration:</b> 1.<b> </b>Activates Incident Command System as needed. 2. Announces to students and staff to stay in, or return to indoor shelter areas. Close all doors and windows, if appropriate. Turn off ventilation system, if appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Announce "<i>All Clear</i>"<i> </i>when the emergency has ended. </p><p><b>Staff:\n</b></p><p>1. Clear the halls of students and staff immediately and report to nearest available classroom or pre-designated shelter locations inside the facility.\n</p><p>2. Teachers keep your emergency go-bag or bucket and notebook or clipboard with you.\n</p><p>3. Assist those with special needs.\n</p><p>4. Close all windows and doors and lock entrances, if appropriate.\n</p><p>5. Seal the room from outside air infiltration, shutting off heating, ventilating or cooling system, if appropriate.\n</p><p>6. Take attendance and turn in <i>Class Status Report Form</i> to Incident Commander when safe to do so.\n</p><p>7. Turn on radio/TV and monitor for further information or instruction.\n</p><p>8. Have students leave their cell phones on their desks. In generalized disasters it is important to keep lines open for emergency. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class). </p><p>9. Stay where you are until instructed otherwise by school authorities. 10. Create a schedule for learning, recreation, eating and sleeping.\n</p><p><b>Lockdown procedure\n</b></p><p>Lockdowns are called for when there is a violent intruder or person with weapon, if a threat of violence or other crisis occurs inside or outside the school and if moving around or evacuation would be dangerous. A distinct loud siren or alarm should be used to signal immediate lockdown. </p><p><b>Administration: </b>sound lockdown signal and announce: "Attention-There is an intruder in the building. Initiate lockdown procedure." <i>Do NOT activate fire alarm!</i> Take cover. Activate Incident Command and prepare to transfer command to police or public safety authorities. Monitor situation.

Gather students into classrooms, maintaining calm. Try to warn other faculty, staff, students and visitors to take immediate shelter. If you are outside the building proceed immediately to a secure area, away from the threat. </p><p>2. Close and lock the doors from inside. Stay out of sight and stay away from doors and windows. Wherever you are, turn all available desks and/or tables onto their sides facing the hallway and/or outside windows, if necessary.\n</p><p>3. Instruct students to drop and cover behind the desks making themselves as small a target as possible. Do <i>not</i> close coverings on outside windows. </p><p>4. Turn off lights and turn off radios and other devices that emit sound. Silence cell phones.\n</p><p>5. Stay where you are until instructed in person by police or school authorities.\n</p><p>6. Follow instructions to continue class and/or use Disaster and Emergency Student Release procedures. </p><p><b>Emergency student release procedure\n</b></p><p>Disaster and emergency student release procedures are intended to ensure that students and families are safely reunited, following any unsafe or unusual circumstances. In the event of an emergency or disaster, students under the age of 16 should not be permitted to leave school except in the company of an adult approved by parent or guardian.\n</p><p><b>Parents: </b>provide and maintain an updated <i>List of Emergency Contacts </i>for their child. This should include parents or guardians and two or three trusted relatives or friends nearby who will be nearby or come to collect student in case of emergency. In the event of emergency or disaster, the student will only be released to persons on this list or authorized by persons on this list.\n</p><p><b>Administration: </b>ensures that <i>List of Emergency Contacts</i> for each student is updated by parents at the beginning of the school year, and can be updated by parents at any time. Maintains the current copy of student emergency contacts in administration office "Go-Box", and annually in the school emergency supplies bin.\n</p><p><b>Teachers: </b>make sure that both students and parents are familiar with student release procedures for emergencies and disasters.\n</p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p><b>Reunification Team: </b>greets parents and emergency contacts at request gate, providing them with <i>Student-Family Reunification Form (permit to release child)</i> form to fill out. Verify that the adult picking up the child is listed on the <i>List of Emergency Contacts</i> and verify their identity. Reunites students at reunification gate. Keeps signed copies of <i>Student-Family Reunification Forms </i>in order to respond to any query.<b> </b>Organizes <i>request</i> and <i>reunification</i> functions for maximum efficiency and safety. </p><p><b>Hazard specific response procedures\n</b></p><p><b>General:\n</b></p><p><b><i>Visitor registration</i></b>: to protect visitors from all hazards, and to protect students and staff from intruders, schools must maintain a single entrance and registration system with nametags for visitors, so that staff and students will know that unfamiliar people have identified themselves before moving around on campus. Communicate these rules widely and assist visitors in the registration process. </p><p><b><i>Emergency calls:</i></b><b> </b>when calling for police, ambulance, fire or other emergency services be prepared to describe WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHAT is happening, WHO you are and how to call you back. Do not hang up until told to do so. For personal safety you should program a next-of-kin phone number under the name "ICE" in your cell phone. This is the universal name for "In Case of Emergency". </p><p><b><i>Medical emergency:</i></b><b> </b>provide immediate medical care and call ambulance if necessary.\n</p><p><b>Threats of Violence: </b>violent incidents at school are not impulsive, random, or epidemic. Prior to most incidents the attacker told someone about his/her idea or plans. There is no accurate profile of a violent offender. Some, but not all violent students have social difficulties, and there are many motivations for violence. Prevention can be achieved by building a climate of trust and respect between students and adults. School should provide a place for open discussion where diversity and differences are allowed and communication is encouraged and supported. Attention must be paid to students\' social and emotional as well as academic needs. </p><p>Whenever any threat is made, <i>do not</i> ignore them, and do not over-react. Threats of violence may be: <i>direct</i>- specific act against a specific target identified in a clear and explicit manner; <i>indirect</i>-<i>v</i>ague, unclear, ambiguous or implied violence; <i>veiled</i>-implied but not explicitly a threat; <i>conditional</i>-warning of violence, if terms are not met (e.g., extortion). A professionally-trained threat assessment team may need to evaluate whether the threat </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p>poses low, medium or high risk, considering student behavior, personality, school, social, and family dynamics. </p><p>• <b><i>If there is a suspicious or unknown persons</i></b>. If you sense a threat, ask a colleague for immediate help. If you feel threatened trust your feelings. Keep distance. Use assertive verbal language and strong body language. Call police as necessary. Call for immediate <i>lockdown</i> if necessary. </p><p>• <b><i>If you encounter bullying.</i></b> School culture should not tolerate bullying and anyone witnessing or experiencing bullying should feel comfortable reporting it and knowing that adults will follow up. Supportive family intervention may be needed for both victims and perpetrators of bullying. For more information see <i>http:// www.stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/kids/\n</i></p><p>• <b><i>If there is a fight among students.</i></b><b> </b>Call or send someone to the office. You are <i>not </i>required to physically intervene.<b> </b>Identify yourself and instruct combatants to stop.<b> </b>Call them by name, instruct spectators to move away.<b> </b>Keep track of events for subsequent report.<b> </b>Dispatch staff to control and disperse onlookers.<b> </b></p><p>• <b><i>If there is a person with a weapon.</i></b><b> </b>Call or send someone to office. You are <i>not </i>required to physically intervene. Try to remain calm. Try not to do anything that will provoke an active shooter. The threat may be high, medium or low risk depending on many factors. One staff member should call police and describe the situation: e.g., static (intruder barricaded somewhere) or dynamic (moving around), any injuries to staff or students, number, location and description of intruders. Also report suspicious devices, with description and location. </p><p>• <b><i>If there is a bomb threat.</i></b> Stay calm. Keep caller on the line. Do not upset the caller. Indicate your willingness to cooperate. Do <i>not</i> pull fire alarm. Signal silently to co-workers to call police, <i>immediately</i>. Permit the caller to say as much as possible without interruption. Take notes on everything said including observation of background noise, voice characteristics, language, etc. Ask as many specific questions as possible. Upon hanging up immediately initiate caller ID if available. Speak with Police. Write everything down. Police will advise if building evacuation is necessary. If so, administration should announce <i>building evacuation</i>. Staff should make a visual check of classroom or immediate area. Anything suspicious should be reported immediately but not touched. School personnel should not handle, search for, or move a suspected bomb. Classroom teacher should evacuate immediate vicinity of any suspicious object. Do not use radios, walkie-talkies or cellular phones to avoid accidentally triggering an explosive device. Staff nearby should turn off stoves, equipment, and gas supply to building. Do not return to the building again until police, fire personnel or administration give the "all clear." </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>• <b><i>When you are in transit. </i></b>When traveling to and from school, to reduce vulnerability to random acts of violence, staff and students should use well-travelled, open routes. Walk assertively and be alert to everything around you, and travel with a buddy or escort, especially at night. There may be some circumstances when authorities advise people to vary their routes, to avoid being targets of attack. Avoid dangers by getting away quickly. Scream loudly for help "Call the Police." A variety of professional and community security patrols may all be important to increasing personal safety.\n</p><p><b>Fire:\n</b></p><p>• <b><i>If you see a fire.</i></b> Put out small fires with fire extinguisher or cover source of fuel with blanket. For modern fire extinguisher use, remember "<i>P.A.S.S."</i>: P<i>ull</i> safety pin from handle. A<i>im</i> at base of the flame. S<i>queeze</i> the trigger handle. S<i>weep</i> from side to side at the base of the flame. Shut off source of fuel if safe to do so (e.g., gas). Activate fire alarm. Alert others. Call emergency telephone number and report location of fire. Evacuate building. Close doors and windows. </p><p>• <b><i>If you hear a fire alarm.</i></b><i> </i>Treat as a real emergency. Follow building evacuation procedures. Never open a closed door without checking first for heat. Do not open a hot door.\n</p><p>• <b><i>If you are caught in smoke. </i></b>Drop down on knees and crawl out. Breathe shallowly through your nose. Hold breath as long as possible. Use damp cloth over mouth and nose. </p><p>• <b><i>If trapped in a room by fire. </i></b>Block smoke from entering with damp cloth, under door. Retreat closing as many doors as possible. Signal and phone your location.\n</p><p>• <b><i>If a person or their clothing is on fire.</i></b> Stop where you are. Drop to ground. Roll over. If another person is on fire, push them down, roll them and/or cover with blanket, rug or coat.\n</p><p><b>Earthquake.</b><b><i> </i></b></p><p><b><i>During the shaking:</i></b><b> </b>at first indication of ground shaking, instruct loudly: "Earthquake position: Drop, Cover and Hold On."

Unplug televisions, computers and other appliances. Lightning can cause power surges and travel through electric lines. Stay away from running water in faucets, sinks and bathtubs. Electricity from lightning can come inside through plumbing. Close window coverings, then stay away from windows. Listen to weather advisories on a battery-powered radio. Obey advisories promptly.<i> </i></p><p>• <b><i>If you are outdoors,</i></b> plan ahead. Know where you\'ll go if an unexpected thunderstorm develops. Monitor weather conditions and be prepared to take immediate action to get to a safe place before the thunderstorm arrives. If you are boating or swimming, get to land, get off the beach and find a safe place immediately. Stay away from water, which can conduct electricity from lightening.<i> </i>Go to safety in a permanent, closed structure, such as a reinforced building. If there are no reinforced structures, get into a car or bus, keeping windows closed. Keep your hands on your lap and feet off the floor.<i> </i>If you are in the woods, find an area protected by a low clump of trees. Never stand under a single, large tree in the open.<i> </i>As a last resort, go to a low-lying, open place. Stay away from tall things-trees, towers, fences, telephone poles, power lines. Be aware of the potential for flooding in low-lying areas. </p><p>• <b><i>If you feel or see lightening</i></b>,<b> </b>(Note: if you feel your hair stand on end, lightning is about to strike.) squat low to the ground <i>on the balls of your feet</i> so that the charge can go through you back into the ground. Place your hands over your ears and bend your head down. Make yourself the smallest target possible. Do <i>not</i> lie flat on the ground!<i> </i></p><p>• <b><i>If lightning strikes a person</i></b>,<i> </i>call for help. Get someone to dial 9-1-1 or your local number for Emergency Medical Services (EMS). A person who has been struck by lightning needs medical attention as quickly as possible. Give first aid. If the person has stopped breathing, begin rescue breathing (if you are properly trained). If the person\'s heart has stopped beating, someone trained in CPR should administer it. Look and care for other possible injuries and check for burns. Move the victim to a safer place. Remember, people struck by lightning carry no electric charge, and they can be handled safely\n</p><p><b>Flood. </b>Follow early-warning instructions.

Practicing, monitoring, and improving\n</b></p><p><b><i>Hold simulation drills to practice, reflect upon and update your plan\n</i></b></p><p>School drills should be tailored to expected hazards. Every school should conduct at least 3 fire drills per year, and at least one full simulation drill. Schools in earthquake or flood prone areas should also practice for these hazards. For every drill that you perform <i>with </i>a prior announcement, be sure to perform one <i>without </i>a prior announcement. Try them with different scenarios, at different times of the day. Try them when the school principal is there and when he or she is not there. The purpose of a drill is to prepare for the unexpected, so if you make it too easy, you won\'t learn how to adapt to the real situation. Drills should always be treated as "the real thing." </p><p>Good drills are a learning process. They begin with advance preparation by staff, providing an opportunity to train students in classroom groups, remember procedures, and check on provisions. The simulation itself is an experiential learning opportunity. Following </p><p>School D isaster M anagem ent\n</p><p>the drill, students can debrief with teachers in the classroom. An "all school" faculty and staff meeting is an important way to debrief, and to discuss ways to improve upon both mitigation measures and response preparedness. The most important part of any drill is the discussion and the updated action plan that comes from the experience. </p><p><b><i>Monitoring indicators for school disaster management\n</i></b></p><p>The <i>School Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist</i> (see Addenda) is offered to guide your reflection on your own progress in implementing school disaster management policies and procedures. It is most rewarding to use this at the beginning of your efforts, to establish your "baseline", and then to repeat this check once a year to measure your progress. These can also be used during preparation for and reflection after school drills, to focus your continuing efforts to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, and assure educational continuity. </p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p> 41 </p><h2><p>References\n</p></h2><p>GFDRR and INEE, Guidelines Notes on Safer School Construction, 2009. <i>http://www.in-eesite.org/index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/ </i></p><p>Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE)<i>, Minimum Standards Handbook (2010), http://www.ineesite.org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/.\n</i>International Finance Corporation, <i>Disaster and Emergency Management Activity Guide for K-6th grade Teachers 2010.\n</i></p><p>International Finance Corporation, <i>General Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines.

Safe school buildings;\n</p><p>2. Disaster prevention education;\n</p><p>3. School disaster and emergency management.\n</p><p><b>Safe school buildings </b>is addressed in the GFDRR/INEE publication, <i>Guidance Notes on Safer School Construction</i> (2009), available in several languages: <i>http://www.ineesite.org/ index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/</i> or <i>http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=10478.\n</i></p><p>In the project development process (new construction, retrofit, and/or remodeling) many of the most critical issues related to school site selection, design for hazard-resilience, and supervised construction should have been addressed. However, the sustainability of safety, the maintenance of school facilities, and the responsibility for educational continuity, rest squarely with the administration and authorities to whom the building is handed over.\n</p><p><b>Disaster prevention education</b> is addressed in the companion publication, <i>Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Activity Guide for K-6th Grade Teachers (IFC 2010)</i> that provides suggested activities for introduction of basic disaster awareness and prevention at an age-appropriate level for primary school students. Integrating disaster prevention knowledge and action into students\' education at school is of critical importance to building a long-term and sustainable "culture of safety" http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13988.\n</p><p>The subject of this handbook, school disaster and emergency preparedness, falls in the middle (yellow) sphere below. Emergency and Disaster Preparedness: Guidance for Schools(2010) is the area that is at the core of "sustainability" of comprehensive school safety. It addresses all of those risk reduction, preparedness and response issues that must be </p><h4><p>C\n</p><p>om prehensive School Safety\n</p></h4><p>addressed and implemented at the local school level, by the school community. <i>http://www. preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13989</i>.\n</p><p>There are also policy issues to be addressed by education authorities at all levels. The international <i>Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies</i>\'<i> (INEE), Minimum Standards Handbook,</i> for education in disasters, addresses emergencies from prevention through to recovery. They are designed to ensure that communities are meaningfully involved in the design and delivery of education programs in emergencies, that efforts are coordinated, accountable, and support the education sector in "building back better." <i>http://www.ineesite. org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/</i>. These are a companion to the SPHERE Project\'s Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response, <i>http://www.sphereproject.org/.\n</i></p><p>Policy issues for education-sector decision-makers are also addressed in <i>School Disaster Prevention: Guidance for Education Sector Decision-Makers (2008), http://www.preventionweb. net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=7556 .\n</i></p><p>Running through the implementation of each of these objectives are the familiar themes of community participation, coordination, and accountability. These objectives are consistent with<i> </i>effective approaches to any social and environmental management system and are intended to extend these principles beyond the initial project stage, throughout the life of the institution. </p><p>This approach to <i>comprehensive school safety</i> follows from IFC\'s performance standards for all projects, especially to those objectives related to risk reduction, safe working conditions, and community health and safety. The guidance here is intended to complement recommendations for emergency plans for response and preparedness outlined in Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines. <i>http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/ EHSGuidelines\n</i></p><p>D\n</p><p>is\n</p><p>as\n</p><p>te\n</p><p>r </p><p>an\n</p><p>d </p><p>Em\n</p><p>er\n</p><p>ge\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>y </p><p>Pr\n</p><p>ep\n</p><p>ar\n</p><p>ed\n</p><p>ne\n</p><p>ss\n</p><p>: </p><p>G\n</p><p>ui\n</p><p>da\n</p><p>nc\n</p><p>e </p><p>fo\n</p><p>r </p><p>Sc\n</p><p>ho\n</p><p>ol\n</p><p>s\n</p><p><b>School Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist </b></p><p>1.

They also provide an important resource for classroom activities and awareness-raising among children and communities.\n\nPlanning for natural disasters and emergencies is something every educational institution must consider, regardless of its size or location.\n\nIt is not possible to plan for every eventuality that might occur; however, preparation is key to saving lives if a disaster strikes.\n\nIFC takes health, safety, and environmental issues very seriously-in relation to its own workplaces and those of its clients and partners.\n\nThese guides draw on a range of resources and experience including that of the World Bank Group\'s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines and the work of the Risk Reduction Education for Disasters group (Risk RED).\n\nThe guides were prepared as part of IFC\'s Health and Education Advisory Services Project (567768). We acknowledge the work of Marla Petal and Rebekah Green.\n\nGuy Ellena\n\nDirector, Health and Education IFC viii\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMore than 400 national disasters take place every year, affecting more than 230 mil-lion people and causing an average of almost 75,000 deaths annually (CRED, 2008). Worldwide, 450 cities with populations over 1 million face recurring earthquakes. Cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes are among the deadliest and costliest of disasters. Droughts and desertification currently affect 250 million people and threaten 1.2 billion people in 110 countries (UNESCO, 2007). Annually recurring floods regularly prevent millions of children from attending a full year of school.\n\nEducation is a human right, universal and inalienable. Education is especially important in enabling people to reach their full potential and exercise other rights. This right does not disappear or get suspended because of disasters and emergencies. When education is interrupted or limited, students drop out, with negative and permanent economic and social impacts for students, their families, and their communities. Natural hazards are part of the context for educational planning. Whether it is annually recurring floods, a once-in-5-generations earthquake, the increasing severity of storms and cyclones, water shortages, or the slow onset of rising sea water levels, these known and expected hazards can be mitigated with the determined application of knowledge, education, and ingenuity.\n\nWe are not able to prevent the earth from shaking, the wind from blowing, or the rain from falling. However, with assessment and planning, physical and environmental protection and response preparedness we can prevent these events from becoming disasters. Since schools are our universal institution for sharing knowledge and skills, the expectations for schools to be role models in disaster prevention is high. Successful disaster mitigation is one of the ultimate tests of the success of the education we provide over generations.\n\nThis Handbook is written for administrators, teachers, support staff, and other individuals involved in emergency and disaster preparedness atschool. Its purposes are:\n\n• To guide administrators and staff in assessing risks and planning and carrying out physical protection measures;\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• To develop skills and provisions for disaster and emergency preparedness, response, and rapid recovery;\n\n• To support schools in developing disaster and emergency plans specific to their local needs and reflecting good practices internationally and nationally.\n\nThis handbook has been prepared with a primary focus on \'school safety\' and thus the language used throughout refers to \'schools\' versus \'universities\'. However, the underlying tenets in terms of the development of policy, planning and implementation is equally relevant regardless of the type of institution in question.\n\n3\n\nSchool Disaster Management\n\nSchool Disaster Management is the process of assessment and planning, physical protection and response capacity development designed to: 1. Protect students and the staff from physical harm; 2. Minimize disruption and ensure the continuity of education for all children; 3. Develop and maintain a culture of safety.\n\nSchool safety and educational continuity require a dynamic, continuous process ini-tiated by management and involving workers, students, parents, and the local com-munity. School disaster management involves the familiar cycle of steps found in all project management: assess hazards, vulnerabilities, capacities and resources; plan and implement for physical risk reduction, maintenance of safe facilities, standard operating procedures and training for disaster response; test mitigation and preparedness plans and skills regularly, with realistic simulation drills; and revise your plan based on your experience.\n\nSchool disaster management mirrors individual and family disaster prevention, and wider community disaster prevention efforts. This guidance document is organized to help remember and observe the parallel processes for disaster prevention that are taken up at every level of society. The full scope of activities is included as follows:\n\n1. Assessment and planning - establishing or empowering your school disaster management committee; assessing your risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities; making contingency plans for educational continuity; communicating your plan. 2. Physical and environmental protection - structural safety maintenance, nonstructural mitigation; local infrastructure and environmental mitigation; fire safety.\n\n3. Response capacity development - standard operating procedures; response skills and organization; response provisions.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n4.

Assessment and planning\n\nAssessment and planning is the starting point for all thoughtful mitigation and safety efforts. For without assessment, planning is arbitrary and without planning, assessment has no purpose. The steps below can be accomplished in a matter of days.\n\nEstablish or empower your school disaster and emergency management committee\n\nSchool safety is the job of the entire school community. This effort requires leadership and coordination by school administration, and involvement and participation from all sectors of the school community.\n\nEach school should establish and maintain an ongoing School Disaster Management Committee (also called a School Safety Committee, or School Disaster and Emergency Management Committee) to oversee disaster risk reduction and preparedness. This may be the job of a pre-existing committee, sub-committee with a similar mission, or one newly established for this purpose. This committee develops, adapts, implements, and updates the school disaster management plan. It will typically meet intensively at the beginning of each school year and monthly during the school year. It will encourage personal and organizational preparedness, guide mitigation work, assure two fire and building evacuation drills annually, lead one full simulation drill annually, evaluate the results, and adjust the plan accordingly. Ideally, the committee is empowered by and maintains formal links between school and disaster management authorities.\n\nSchool Disaster Management Committee members need strong leadership (ideally the school principal or assistant principal). The committee is most effective when it involves representatives of all major stakeholder groups, such as those listed below:\n\n• School administration;\n\n• Teachers - larger schools should make sure that all major departments or sections of school faculty and staff are represented;\n\n• Staff - this includes facilities, maintenance, nutrition, security, health, counseling, transportation etc.\n\n• Parents - this should be linked to the parent-teacher association or similar school welfare committee;\n\n• School neighbors - this includes neighborhood civic association, large businesses, and public safety officials. It may be accomplished through communication and liaison where appropriate with police, fire services, emergency management authorities, neighborhood association, local business partners, school board, neighborhood elected officials and so on;\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• Vulnerable groups members - it may also be important to have an individual representing people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups whose needs might otherwise be overlooked;\n\n• Students - ideally, this will be an elected representative from the student body.\n\nRepresentatives are needed to facilitate two-way communication between all concerned groups, in the process of planning.\n\nMembers should remember that resilience is not accomplished all at once, but is a continuous process that can be broken down into small steps. Every small step is important in reaching the goals of safety and educational continuity. The committee might start by creating a calendar of activities to develop awareness and build momentum throughout the school year. Major milestones include:\n\n• Form or re-form committee;\n\n• Distribute Family Disaster Plan forms to staff, students and families;\n\n• Complete School Hazard Impact Assessment;Identify vulnerabilities and capacities;\n\n• Prioritize mitigation activities;\n\n• Develop staff training plan;\n\n• Review basic emergency and standard operating procedures;\n\n• Conduct school and neighborhood hazard hunt;\n\n• Check School Evacuation Route Maps posted in each classroom and corridor;\n\n• Check fire suppression equipment;\n\n• Identify campus and neighborhood risks, and resources on maps;\n\n• Post neighborhood and school campus maps prominently;\n\n• Check and re-supply administration, nursing office, and classroom Go-Bags;\n\n• Request student comfort kits from families;\n\n• Check and re-supply first aid kits and emergency supplies;\n\n• Communicate student-family reunification procedures to parents;\n\n• Update student emergency release permissions;\n\n• Schedule fire drill and full simulation drills;\n\n• Practice drills with each class;\n\n• Minimum of two annual fire and building evacuation drills;\n\n• Implement full simulation drill for other hazards.\n\n• Evaluate drill and revise plans and procedures.\n\nIt is a good idea to have one large school safety bulletin board in a prominent location, which the committee can use to share information and to create and maintain disaster pre-\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nvention awareness in the school community. It is particularly important for the committee to remember that students of all ages can and should be involved, as much as possible and as appropriate, in all aspects of school disaster prevention. This learning experience will contribute to a culture of safety for future generations. Students can be involved as rotating classroom representatives, student government volunteers, scout volunteers, and through extra-curricular activities.\n\nA School Disaster Plan is always a work-in-progress, and never a finished document. Successful plans emphasize planning as a process, rather than a neatly bound document. In the course of the steps below, you will generate and re-generate live documentation that will constitute your "plan." What is of crucial importance is having everyone participate in the planning, and learning and continuing to develop the plan through practice.\n\nAssess risks, hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities\n\nRisks are assessed by considering potential hazards (whether these are natural, man-made, or combined), in relationship to a community\'s vulnerability characteristics (i.e., the circumstances that make it susceptible to damaging effects of a hazard. Vulnerabilities apply to groups of people and to individuals, to the built environment and infrastructure, and to the natural environment. For example, young children, older adults, people with disabilities, poor people, minority language groups, recent immigrants, and illiterate people tend to be more vulnerable. Buildings not constructed to withstand hazards are vulnerable. Coastlines unprotected by coral reefs and mangrove forests are vulnerable to high winds. Marine life is vulnerable to oil spills, and so on.\n\nThe steps below will guide you to document the hazards you face, the vulnerability characteristics of people and places, and the resulting risks. Constructing your own risk matrix can help to see the larger picture, and focus and prioritize your efforts to reduce vulnerabilities and risks. This should be approached through research and dialogue.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nAssessing your hazards and risks\n\nUsing the Risk Assessment Matrix in the Addenda, work as a group to fill in the chart, taking these steps:\n\nA. Identify all of the hazards that your school community may face. These may be of "natural" and/or "man-made" origin.\n\nB. Discuss how likely these hazards are. In the case of earthquake, flood, volcano, landslide and similar, check with scientific and technical or disaster management authorities to be sure that you have an accurate understanding of these likelihoods. Some hazards are ever-present, some seasonal, some increase, and some are infrequent but inevitable. Rate the likelihood on a scale of 1 to 5. You should be planning for what may happen sometime during your school career, or your children and grandchildren\'s school years.\n\nHAZARDS 1 2 3 4 5\n\nLikelihood Very low Low Medium High Very high\n\nC. Rate the impact severity for each of these hazards on a scale of 1 to 5. When rating impact severity, consider the wide range of losses that your school and community face, including these factors:\n\n• Human-deaths, injuries, disability;\n\n• Physical-damage to buildings, equipment, supplies;\n\n• Socia Cultural-disruption and loss of friends, mentors, communities, cultural heritage;\n\n• Economic-cost of repair and replacement, cost to students and families of delayed or incomplete education, loss of livelihoods in education;\n\n• Environmental-loss of natural resources and habitats;\n\n• Psychosocial-lost continuities, hopes and dreams;\n\n• Educational-disrupted or degraded services, quality, outcomes.\n\nYour community may be better prepared for some hazards than for others. As you reduce your vulnerabilities there will be less to worry about.\n\nVULNERABILITIES 1 2 3 4 5\n\nImpact severity Minor Controllable Critical Devastating Terminal\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nD.

The location, design and construction of a building can increase or decrease your school\'s vulnerability in the case of fire, earthquake, flood, landslide, snow or windstorm, extreme temperature, volcanic hazards, or bomb threats.\n\nIf you have identified these hazards as priorities, ideally you will already have taken structural safety measures in the course of school site selection and school construction, retrofit or remodeling. Note that for IFC projects, structural engineers and architects responsible for facilities, buildings, plants and structures should certify the applicability and appropriateness of the design criteria employed (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.81).\n\nThe School Building Safety Checklist in the Addenda will help you to identify any issues that would benefit from a closer look. This includes:\n\n• Location and soil;\n\n• Load carrying system;\n\n• Building height;\n\n• Design;\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• Construction detailing;\n\n• Water damage.\n\nIdentify any structural safety concerns that may require further investigation. You may need the support of a qualified engineer or architect to undertake this assessment with you. If any of these conditions apply to your buildings, you will need to investigate further with professional engineering help. As warranted by engineering investigation, develop a strategy for mitigating structural deficiencies through retrofitting or during ongoing remodeling.\n\nAssessing non-structural safety\n\nIf you have prioritized fire, earthquake, flood, and windstorms you will need to take a step further to assess non-structural risks associated with your buildings. This will help to identify those measures that can be taken to make classrooms, offices, and common spaces safer. The review team should include users of each space as well as facilities maintenance staff. Use your imagination and common sense as you go from room to room, and around the building.\n\nFire prevention and fire safety measures are part of your initial school design, and also require regular maintenance and testing. Assess to be sure that:\n\n• Flammable and hazardous materials sources are limited, isolated, eliminated, or secured. This includes electrical lines and appliances, heaters and stoves, natural gas pipes and LPG canisters, flammable or combustible liquids;\n\n• Exit routes are clear to facilitate safe evacuation in case of fire or other emergency;\n\n• Detection and alarm systems are working;\n\n• Fire extinguishers are regularly refilled;\n\n• Other fire suppression and control equipment is regularly tested and maintained;\n\n• Mechanical, electrical, and civil structures and systems are maintained and operable, in compliance with life and fire safety design criteria (IFC EHS Guidelines 2007 p.80).\n\nFor cyclone/high winds safety think about objects that can be torn away, fly away or be battered by wind outside. Note what can be done, and who should do it.\n\nFor earthquake safety think about objects that may slide, fall, or fly, and especially anything that can cause injury or block exits. Note what can be done, who should do it, and when it should be completed.\n\nPrioritize the items as follows:\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Priority 1: secure items that can kill or injure or block exits (e.g., heavy equipment, heating/cooling units, pipes, storage tanks, overhead lighting, bookshelves, hazardous chemicals, things blocking exits). Note that all exit doors should open outwards.\n\n• Priority 2: secure things can cause significant economic or cultural loss, cause injury, or impair educational continuity (e.g., computers, audio-visual equipment, school awards, and breakables).\n\n• Priority 3: secure things that, if damaged, can impede recovery.\n\nAssessing capacities and resources for mitigation, response and recovery\n\nYour school community also has many strengths, capacities and resources that need to be identified and mobilized. As you read through this guide you will develop a good grasp of some of the physical protection measures, as well as response and recovery skills and resources that you will need. Make a list of all of these needs. Then, in your school community, identify the people and places with the knowledge, skills, and provisions you need, and find out how you can activate that capacity to reduce your risks and speed your recovery. Identify resources and problem-solve to fill the gaps. Include name, skills/resources, location and contact information.\n\nIn terms of knowledge and skills for risk reduction, think about: structural engineers, environmental engineers, safety experts, facilities staff, handymen, plumbers, electricians, builders. For response and recovery, think about: emergency management experts, health professionals, volunteer groups, scouts, women, organizing volunteers, obtaining supplies, communication experts, shelter construction, and supplies management. Find out what response skills your staff and students already have. Use this assessment to plan for needed training to fill the gaps.\n\nFinally, consider the provisions you will need for response and recovery. As a rule of thumb, collectively as a community you should plan to be able to take care of yourselves for seven days. Between home, school, and work everyone will need four liters of water per person/per day, high energy food. As a school community you will be expected to provide leadership in this. Planning for shelter and sanitation and a site for stockpiling communal supplies are all reasonable expectations from schools.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nCreative problem solving to bridge the gap between needs and resources: in one university, a single supplier delivers drinking water to many buildings and departments, but none had extra supplies. The university made a one-time purchase of emergency water supplies. Now the water supplier uses this stockpile to distribute throughout the university, and re-stocks it, so that the university will always have a fresh emergency water supply.\n\nUsing school and neighborhood risk and resource maps\n\nSchool site map and neighborhood maps are indispensible tools for recording and visualizing risks and resources on your campus and in your community. They will help you recognize and think through how to fill the gaps between vulnerabilities and capacities.\n\nOn the School Map mark vulnerabilities and resources such as:\n\n• Entrances and exits\n\n• Visitor check-in point\n\n• Emergency assembly area\n\n• Gas line shut off location(s)\n\n• Electricity shut off location(s)\n\n• Water shut off location(s)\n\n• Building evacuation routes\n\n• Building dangers\n\n• Underground dangers\n\n• Overhead dangers\n\n• Hazardous materials locations\n\n• Fire suppression equipment locations\n\n• First Aid staging area\n\n• Request and Reunification gates\n\n• Individuals with disabilities and young children\n\n• Response provisions on-site\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nOn the Neighborhood Map mark vulnerabilities and resources such as:\n\n• Emergency evacuation routes\n\n• Emergency vehicle routes\n\n• Alternate assembly area, shelters, and safe havens\n\n• Health facilities\n\n• Fire station\n\n• Hazardous materials sites\n\n• Tools (e.g., generator)\n\n• Resource people\n\n• Transportation resources\n\n• Vulnerable populations (elderly, young children)\n\n• Vulnerable building, roads, and facilities\n\n• Resource people for response and recovery\n\n• Response provisions off-site\n\nPost these maps on your school safety bulletin board, and make them part of your staff handbook and staff orientation. Review and revise these maps as you develop and revise your disaster prevention plan.\n\nContingency planning for educational continuity\n\nWhen students are out-of-school for any prolonged period of time, drop-out rates increase, resulting in lifelong negative impacts. Staff unemployment also follows. In addition to all of the steps taken for hazard and resource assessment, physical protection, and response capacity development, you will also need to have contingency plans for how to continue providing education to students as quickly as possible following hazard impact. This is especially true for schools that face recurring hazards such as annual floods. Alternate sites, temporary shelters, delivery of homework packets, radio and television delivery of lessons are just some of the creative alternatives for making sure that education continues. In the post-disaster period, students will also need to participate in recovery efforts, and have time set aside for a variety of psychosocial support activities, and opportunities for communal grief recovery, to ease their adjustment to the sudden losses in their lives. This may include people, homes, jobs, communities and tangible cultural heritage.\n\nYour school, if in good condition, may also be called upon to be used as an emergency shelter, further disrupting education. If you use private services for security, catering and transportation, these companies should be included in your planning process. Have memoranda of understanding ahead of time with engineers who can inspect your building for safety, water pumping equipment providers, and various other contingency steps can be taken in advance and speed your recovery.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nCommunicating your plan\n\nSchool faculty and staff, students, parents, and local community leaders and first responders all need to be familiar with your plans, in order for them to work effectively. Community members have a great deal to offer the school disaster management process, supporting in risk reduction activities, participating in school drills, volunteering during response and recovery, and providing response supplies.\n\nYou may want to hold special meetings with local public safety representatives, and an open meeting for your entire school community to communicate your plans and invite participation and support. Communicate this information in as many ways as possible (written, audio, visual, demonstration, and through younger students). Translate as necessary to include everyone.\n\nStaff need to understand your expectations of them. If a disaster occurs, when are they expected to report to work? How they will organize shifts? Which individuals may not be able to stay because young children or elderly family members are at home. Open discussion and realistic planning will help. Everyone will want to know what notification systems you will be using (telephone tree, posted notice on building, radio, automated phone messages, e-mail, school web-page).\n\nParents need to be knowledgeable and involved. It is essential for disaster preparedness that parents know and trust that their children will be safe and cared for at school, until the danger has passed or outside help arrives, even for two to three days! Let them know, in advance, all emergency procedures.\n\nClearly explain student release procedures to parents, students and community members. Students will be released only to parent/guardian or other pre-authorized emergency contact (who should bring photo identification with them). Provide information about alternate evacuation and reunification site, especially if your school grounds are not likely to be safe because of nearby hazards. Explain that in case of a lockdown, the school will not be able to answer incoming phone calls or make outside calls. Police will provide assistance. No one, including parents, will be allowed near the school. Students will be kept inside and not permitted to leave until the lockdown is lifted by the police. After that, parents may come to school to pick up their children.\n\nAs part of this communication process, you should ask parents to provide:\n\n• Emergency contact information: in order to implement student release procedures, be sure that parent and emergency contact information is updated at the beginning of each school year and that parents notify the school of changes during the school year.\n\n• Student comfort bags: these hold essential supplies each child in case of emergency (see Section 3.C below).\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nAnd last but not least, students will be empowered participants in disaster prevention, now and in the future, if they are fully and thoughtfully included in communicating school safety plans.\n\n2. Physical and environmental protection\n\nYour plan to reduce vulnerability and risks will need to consider:\n\n• Structural safety - this addresses the safety of buildings on or near the school site;\n\n• Non-structural safety - this addresses the threats posed by building furnishings and equipment as well as building elements such as roofs, windows, stairs, heating and cooling systems, water storage, pipes, and exit routes. This includes fire safety;\n\n• Local infrastructure - this addresses lifeline utilities such as water, electricity, gas, as well as communications and transportation conduits. It also covers transportation safety;\n\n• Environmental mitigation - this addresses ambient conditions such as temperature, inundation, hazardous materials release, and climate change impacts.\n\nThe dos and don\'ts below will assist in identifying and implementing these protection measures.\n\nStructural safety maintenance\n\nWhile implementation of structural safety measures is beyond the scope of this document, building maintenance is a critical component in the maintenance of structural and nonstructural safety. Damage should be repaired as discovered, and structural safety should not be compromised through alteration and misuse. Responsibility for this rests with local school administration and designated facilities and maintenance personnel.\n\nCheck to be sure that you:\n\n• Do not compromise columns or beams by cutting, exposing, or making holes in them;\n\n• Do not let reinforcing steel be exposed to air or moisture;\n\n• Do cover exposed steel with concrete mortar;\n\n• Fix wood rot, cracked mortar, cracked bricks, and concrete damage;\n\n• Keep gutters and drainage systems clear of debris;\n\n• Make sure that water and moisture drains away from building;\n\n• Replace broken glass.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nNon-structural safety\n\nNon-structural safety measures are those that are not connected with the weight-bearing system of the building, and those that are in the hands of users. This includes fire prevention and readily available fire suppression equipment. Special attention is required to make sure that all building occupants can safely exit in case building evacuation is necessary. In case of earthquake and storms, the main considerations are injury prevention both within and immediately outside buildings.\n\nDo check that:\n\n• All classroom doors, doors of high-occupancy rooms, and doors to outside open outwards;\n\n• Exit pathways are kept clear;\n\n• Non-structural building elements are securely fastened to the building to resist wind or earthquake\n\n• shaking;\n\n• Fire suppression equipment is located appropriately and maintained in good working condition;\n\n• Flammable and combustible materials are limited, isolated, eliminated, and separated, away from • dangerous interactions and heat sources;\n\n• Electrical systems are maintained and are not overloaded;\n\n• Classrooms have two exits wherever possible. (Sometimes the second exit is a window.)\n\nIf you face earthquakes and windstorms:\n\n• Move heavy items below head level;\n\n• Tightly secure tall and heavy furniture and appliance to walls, floors and ceilings. (e.g., use L-brackets to walls or spring-loaded adjustable tension rods to ceiling or wedges under bottom front, or strip barrier fastened to tabletop, as appropriate);\n\n• Fasten cabinet doors and drawers with latches that will hold shut during shaking; Secure heaters and cooling systems suspended inside or outside of building;\n\n• Fasten liquid propane gas tanks, fire extinguishers and other gas cylinders to the wall;\n\n• Protect from glass that may break into large shards (e.g., rearrange furniture, use window film, curtains, or install strengthened glass.);\n\n• Secure heavy and important electronic items to table top or floor using straps and\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Secure lighting fixtures to ceiling;\n\n• Fasten pictures on closed hooks;\n\n• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials.\n\nAnd for floods:\n\n• Raise important items above possible flood level;\n\n• Limit, isolate, eliminate or secure hazardous (poison, flammable) materials above flood level.\n\nLocal infrastructure safety\n\nLocal infrastructure includes the water, electricity, gas, heating and cooling systems, communications and transportation systems in your area. These are usually part of larger systems maintained by government and private agencies. Careful design and problem-solving with these organizations, ahead of time, can protect students and educational assets, and make these systems resilient. Depending on the hazards faced, a wide variety of solutions can be considered:\n\n• Relocate overhead wires and poles that may block exit routes;\n\n• Install automatic natural gas shut off valves at building level;\n\n• Use flexible connectors for pipes;\n\n• Consider dangers posed by overhead and underground pipes and depots;\n\n• Replace radioactive lightening rods with those that do not pose health risk.\n\nTransportation safety may involve road and pedestrian crossing conditions as well as operations of school or contractor buses or minivans. On an annual basis, worldwide, transportation accidents are the leading cause of student deaths and injuries. Clear lines of sight and signage, stop signs, traffic lights, clearly marked pedestrian crosswalks, and crossing-guards at busy crossings are all important safety measures. Vehicle safety, driver testing and training, and installation, maintenance, and use of seat belts, and careful routing are all of importance in ensuring that students are safe in school transport. Once on school transportation, rules of access and conduct, and adult supervision are also important factors.\n\nEnvironmental safety\n\nEnvironmental safety issues bring schools into focus in their local environments. Thinking through all of the conditions that you face, what are some of the environmental safety issues to explore to increase your own safety?\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nThere are other ways that your school community can be involved in environmental protection and climate change mitigation-through "green school" measures and through community activities such as environmental clean-up, anti-litter signage, awareness campaigns and similar activities to encourage citizens to reduce, re-use and recycle.\n\n3. Response capacity development\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle involves the development of response capacity. This includes the systematic organization of response, standard response skills (including basic emergency procedures and procedures for specific hazards), and accessing provisions during an emergency. Details on each follows.\n\nResponse organization using Incident Command Systems (ICS)\n\nResponse capacity involves knowledge, procedures, skills, and provisions. The most important aspect of response capacity is organization and mobilization of existing skills and resources. A standard emergency management system, such as Incident Command Systems (ICS) shown in the diagram at the bottom of this section, can be used as a guiding framework for coordinating the many standard functions that may be called for in different emergency situations.\n\nIncident command systems\n\nThe purpose of ICS is to ensure that the most help reaches the most people, and to provide a consistent system that staff, students, and emergency personnel can apply in any school, anywhere. Key principles are:\n\nConditions Solutions to explore\n\nExtreme weather during school year school design, alternate locations, alternate delivery methods\n\nLandslide tree-planting, slope stabilization, retaining wall, evacuation routes\n\nForest fires fire breaks\n\nTsunami evacuation routes, stairs, ladder\n\nDrought / Food insecurity rainwater harvesting, school gardens, tree planting, food storage\n\nSolid waste management recycling point\n\nWater and energy shortage and costs water and energy conservation\n\nHazardous materials production or storage\n\ncommunity "right-to-know", regular review of safety measures, facility tours and dialogues\n\nAir pollution walking and bicycling to school, car-pooling\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Standardization - the use of common terminology (and no codes);\n\n• Unified chain of command in order to assign resources for maximum effectiveness;\n\n• Flexible, modular organization, mobilized as needed; and\n\n• Integrated communications.\n\nThere are five key functions in ICS are that can be mobilized as needed in the particular circumstances. These five functions form a common approach to organize response to any emergency or disaster. Depending on the number of staff and trusted volunteers or capable older-students available, some people may need to have multiple roles.\n\n• Incident command: these are decision-makers (responsible for/set mission) Although someone in your school may be designated as "Emergency Manager" under normal circumstances, in case of actual disaster or emergency, the "Incident Commander" is the first capable person on the scene, until that function can be transferred to a more qualified person or higher authority. Even if normally that person is a Principal or Assitant Principal, several different people should practice in this role, as those indiviuals may or may not be available during an actual emergency or disaster. The "Incident Commander" mobilizes the on-site "Incident Command Center."\n\n• Communications team: these are communicators (listeners and talkers)\n\nThe communications team is the right arm of the Incident Commander, establishing connections with education administration, public safety, and emergency management authorities, and with parents and the public, as directed. When communications systems are operational some information can be disseminated using telephone trees, and radio announcements. In large-scale disasters the key communications are with students (often by the school principal or assistant principal, using a megaphone to communicate) and with parents anticipating reunification with students.\n\n• Operations branch: these are doers (carry out the mission)\n\nThis branch requires a highly organized and well-respected Operations Chief, who manages teams to fulfill: light search and rescue, fire suppression and hazardous materials control, utility shut-off, disaster first aid, psychosocial support, security, and student release/family reunification functions.\n\n• Logistics branch: these are getters/supporters (support the mission)\n\nThis branch requires a Logistics Chief, who knows the site and its resources best. These teams will find and distribute supplies and provisions, shelter and sanitation, water and nutrition, and organize volunteer recruitment and assignment.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n• Information and planning: these are documenters and analyzers (support the mission)\n\nThis branch is typically mobilized in advance of a disaster, identifying and researching resources, executing memoranda of understanding in advance. During an incident it documents the situation, activities, and assures accurate record keeping.\n\n• Finance/administrators: these are payers (pay and negotiate)\n\nThis function typically keeps records of resources and staff time expended during any emergency, arranging compensation where permitted, and negotiating as needed for access to needed resources.\n\nICS is a flexible system that can be activated to different levels, depending on the situation. For example, an intruder on campus, a fight between students, or traffic accident might be handled by activating Level I alone. A small fire or flood might require Level II activation. A major disaster, such as an earthquake might require full activation of multiple teams at Level III. Maintaining this structure allows more responders to be integrated, maintaining the chain of command, and a manageable span of control (i.e., 5-8 people per supervisor). It is not normally recommended to have permanent teams with single functions because each situation differs, and may call for more or fewer people on any particular team. As much as resources permit, staff should cross-train. Even if response teams are formed ahead of time, staff should understand and be prepared to assume any response role, as needed. Incident Command Systems are designed to be flexible, and to activate from the top down, only to the level, and only those functions required by the particular disaster or emergency.\n\nStandard operating procedures\n\nStandard emergency response procedures depend on the hazard, and can and should be customized to your unique circumstances. These are built around six basic emergency procedures detailed below:\n\n• Building evacuation;\n\n• Shelter-in-place;\n\n• Lockdown;\n\n• Assemble and shelter outside;\n\n• Evacuate to safe haven;\n\n• Emergency student release/family reunification.\n\nEach of the procedures is described in detail below. Remember that individuals with disabilities, foreign language speakers and visitors unfamiliar with these procedures may\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nneed assistance in following them. The Emergency Procedures Decision-Tree that follows illustrates the different circumstances that lead to these six basic procedures.\n\nQuestion #1-Is there any warning before the hazard impact? Is the hazard rapid-onset, without warning (such as acts of violence, earthquake, fire), or is it a slow or medium-onset hazard with some early warning (such as floods, cyclone, winter storms, etc.)? In the case of medium onset events with early warning, school maybe closed, and alternate education\n\nIncident Command Systems Organigram\n\nSchool Safety/School Disaster & Emergency Management Committee\n\nSafety Officer\n\nOperations\n\nDamage Assessment Light Search & Rescue\n\nFire Suppression\n\nFirst Aid\n\nPsychosocial Support\n\nStudent Supervision\n\nStudent Release\n\nEquipment & Supplies\n\nVolunteering & Staffing\n\nTransportation & Traffic\n\nShelter & Sanitation\n\nWater & Food\n\n  Planning, Analysis\n\n  & Finance\n\n  Documentation\n\nProcurement\n\nLogistics\n\nAdministration, Finance & Documentation\n\nManagement/ Commander\n\nCommunications Team\n\nLiaison Officer\n\nPublic Information Officer\n\nLevel I\n\nLevel II\n\nLevel III\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\ndelivery methods set into motion. In this case, normal student-release procedures would be applied. In some situations, schools may be the shelter-of-choice for the local community. In the case of violence (person with weapon, terrorist activity) administration should announce a lockdown.\n\nQuestion #2-Is the building safe? The second question is whether the building is safe. If the building is unsafe then building evacuation should be immediately triggered. In the case of rapid onset hazards such as fire and earthquake, the building must be assumed to be unsafe, and therefore cautious building evacuation should be automatically triggered. (Note that during earthquake shaking, everyone should "drop, cover and hold on" and that evacuation should only begin once the shaking has stopped.) In other situations a rapid assessment can be made before evacuation. If the building is safe then the students and staff should be instructed to shelter-in-place. Reverse evacuation is practiced for orderly return from assembly area back into classrooms, to shelter-in-place.\n\nQuestion #3-Are the school grounds are safe? If school grounds are safe then assemble and shelter outside is the procedure. If school grounds are known to be unsafe (e.g., in coastal area with tsunami risk) then automatic evacuation to safe haven should take place. A rapid assessment (e.g., of hazardous materials, fallen power lines, pipeline ruptures) will help decide between these two options.\n\nIn all cases, following assembly, reassessment should take place periodically and one of these actions maintained. In the case of real disasters and emergencies incidents, emergency student release procedures should be initiated, ensuring that students are returned directly and only to the care of parents/guardians or their pre-designated emergency contacts, and each reunion documented. Students should remain cared for and supervised until the last student is reunited and the All Clear is given by the incident commander (explained in the next section). In the case of drills and small events a reverse evacuation may be practiced to return to class, prior to "All Clear" instruction and resumption of classes.\n\nBuilding evacuation, evacuation to safe haven and assembly procedure\n\nAdministration: sounds fire alarm; makes announcement to students and staff. In case of fire, close doors and windows. In case of hazardous materials, close ventilation system. Activate Incident Command System as appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Maintain communication. Announce any new procedure. Announce "All Clear" when emergency has ended.\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nStaff: ahead of time, practice as a class, following both fire and earthquake procedures. Identify any students or staff who may need special assistance during evacuation. Learn from these individuals how best to help them. Teach students how to provide assistance ahead of time. In schools with large numbers of disabled students needing assistance, volunteers should be recruited from the immediate vicinity and trained. Be prepared to help visitors as well.\n\nAt time of alarm or after earthquake shaking stops:\n\n1. Remind students to follow instructions for building evacuation: "Don\'t Talk. Don\'t Push. Don\'t Run. Don\'t Turn Back." Students should exit with buddies in twos. Check that students or staff needing special assistance have it. Remind students NOT to use cell phones, to keep lines free for emergency communications!\n\n2. Take your:\n\n• Classroom Go-Bag or Go-Bucket;\n\n• Emergency clipboard or notebook with class lists and Class Status Report Forms (See Addenda);\n\n• Duffle bag packed with student comfort bags.\n\n3. Use the buddy system. Take a few seconds to check briefly with the teacher in the classroom to the left, to the right, and across the hall to see if they are in need. Unless instructed otherwise, evacuate using normal building evacuation routes posted. If you encounter obstructions, such as jammed door, be prepared to take an alternate route. One teacher should be in the front to check that the evacuation route is clear. One responsible student monitor should be immediately behind the teacher, keeping students quiet and orderly. One teacher and responsible student monitor should be at the rear of the group, seeing that everyone is together. Move directly away from the building when exiting. Designated teachers from each wing should check washrooms as they exit.\n\n4. Take your seat in the emergency assembly area (normally, organized by first period or homeroom class). Keep classes separate and take roll. Check again for injuries. If any students are injured, send them with two buddies to the First Aid station, with instructions to return together immediately. For large schools, mount your classroom identification sign at front of group above head level. Fill out your Classroom Status Report Form and return it to Incident Command Center with student runner.\n\n5. Remind students about student-release procedures and their purpose to keep them safe. Remind them not to use their cell phones in order to keep lines open for emergency. For emergency communication, use SMS only. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class).\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n6. If you are a member of the Search and Rescue, First Aid Team or Fire Suppression Team, have the teacher next to you supervise your class and proceed to the Incident Command Center.\n\n7. Teachers are to remain with their class AT ALL TIMES. Students must remain seated together as a class. Periodically call roll as needed. Keep students quiet so that they can hear information from the public address or megaphone/bullhorn system that will be used for announcements. Children are to leave only in the company of reunion gate messengers. The Incident Command Center will provide updates and relieve staff of their assignments.\n\nNote: all personnel without a specific duty or class are to immediately report to the Incident Command Center for instructions. All teaching assistants and campus aides who do not have a class are to report immediately to the assembly area to assist with the supervision of students.\n\nEvacuation to safe haven: all schools should designate an alternate site for assembly should school grounds need to be evacuated. Identify evacuation routes ahead of time, and inform parents of this alternate site. Schools that face known risks such as flooding, landslide, debris flow, tsunami, chemical release, or schools that do not have a safe assembly area on-site, should arrange and prepare safe havens ahead of time with emergency supplies. If necessary, also arrange transportation to your safe haven depending on the threats you face, evacuation to safe haven may be automatic (e.g., following earthquake in coastal areas with tsunami threat), or you may wait for evaluation by on-site incident commander and assessment team.\n\nReverse evacuation: there may also be times when it becomes necessary to go back inside, because inside is safer than outside. Practice reverse evacuation at the end of your drills, when you go back to your classrooms, following all of the same rules.\n\nN.B. Always assume and act as though an alarm is signaling a real threat. Whether an alarm is a real situation, a drill, or even a false alarm, safety demands that you practice your response procedures as though it were real event!\n\nShelter in place procedure\n\nYou may be requested to shelter-in-place when there are dangers outside the school that prevent normal student release, such as severe weather or flooding, nuclear, biological or chemical incident or terrorist attack. Shelter-in-place is appropriate when evacuation is not\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nnecessary, or when there is not time to evacuate. It should be announced throughout the school using a public address system or face-to-face communication.\n\nAdministration: 1. Activates Incident Command System as needed. 2. Announces to students and staff to stay in, or return to indoor shelter areas. Close all doors and windows, if appropriate. Turn off ventilation system, if appropriate. Monitor and provide updates and instructions as available. Announce "All Clear" when the emergency has ended.\n\nStaff:\n\n1. Clear the halls of students and staff immediately and report to nearest available classroom or pre-designated shelter locations inside the facility.\n\n2. Teachers keep your emergency go-bag or bucket and notebook or clipboard with you.\n\n3. Assist those with special needs.\n\n4. Close all windows and doors and lock entrances, if appropriate.\n\n5. Seal the room from outside air infiltration, shutting off heating, ventilating or cooling system, if appropriate.\n\n6. Take attendance and turn in Class Status Report Form to Incident Commander when safe to do so.\n\n7. Turn on radio/TV and monitor for further information or instruction.\n\n8. Have students leave their cell phones on their desks. In generalized disasters it is important to keep lines open for emergency. Keep students occupied as helpers, and in quiet activities during student release (or until all clear signal and return to class).\n\n9. Stay where you are until instructed otherwise by school authorities. 10. Create a schedule for learning, recreation, eating and sleeping.\n\nLockdown procedure\n\nLockdowns are called for when there is a violent intruder or person with weapon, if a threat of violence or other crisis occurs inside or outside the school and if moving around or evacuation would be dangerous. A distinct loud siren or alarm should be used to signal immediate lockdown.\n\nAdministration: sound lockdown signal and announce: "Attention-There is an intruder in the building. Initiate lockdown procedure." Do NOT activate fire alarm! Take cover. Activate Incident Command and prepare to transfer command to police or public safety authorities. Monitor situation. Reassess and provide updates and instructions as available.

Following incident inform students and parents, as appropriate, providing time for review and discussion.\n\nStaff:\n\n1. Gather students into classrooms, maintaining calm. Try to warn other faculty, staff, students and visitors to take immediate shelter. If you are outside the building proceed immediately to a secure area, away from the threat.\n\n2. Close and lock the doors from inside. Stay out of sight and stay away from doors and windows. Wherever you are, turn all available desks and/or tables onto their sides facing the hallway and/or outside windows, if necessary.\n\n3. Instruct students to drop and cover behind the desks making themselves as small a target as possible. Do not close coverings on outside windows.\n\n4. Turn off lights and turn off radios and other devices that emit sound. Silence cell phones.\n\n5. Stay where you are until instructed in person by police or school authorities.\n\n6. Follow instructions to continue class and/or use Disaster and Emergency Student Release procedures.\n\nEmergency student release procedure\n\nDisaster and emergency student release procedures are intended to ensure that students and families are safely reunited, following any unsafe or unusual circumstances. In the event of an emergency or disaster, students under the age of 16 should not be permitted to leave school except in the company of an adult approved by parent or guardian.\n\nParents: provide and maintain an updated List of Emergency Contacts for their child. This should include parents or guardians and two or three trusted relatives or friends nearby who will be nearby or come to collect student in case of emergency. In the event of emergency or disaster, the student will only be released to persons on this list or authorized by persons on this list.\n\nAdministration: ensures that List of Emergency Contacts for each student is updated by parents at the beginning of the school year, and can be updated by parents at any time. Maintains the current copy of student emergency contacts in administration office "Go-Box", and annually in the school emergency supplies bin.\n\nTeachers: make sure that both students and parents are familiar with student release procedures for emergencies and disasters.\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nReunification Team: greets parents and emergency contacts at request gate, providing them with Student-Family Reunification Form (permit to release child) form to fill out. Verify that the adult picking up the child is listed on the List of Emergency Contacts and verify their identity. Reunites students at reunification gate. Keeps signed copies of Student-Family Reunification Forms in order to respond to any query. Organizes request and reunification functions for maximum efficiency and safety.\n\nHazard specific response procedures\n\nGeneral:\n\nVisitor registration: to protect visitors from all hazards, and to protect students and staff from intruders, schools must maintain a single entrance and registration system with nametags for visitors, so that staff and students will know that unfamiliar people have identified themselves before moving around on campus. Communicate these rules widely and assist visitors in the registration process.\n\nEmergency calls: when calling for police, ambulance, fire or other emergency services be prepared to describe WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHAT is happening, WHO you are and how to call you back. Do not hang up until told to do so. For personal safety you should program a next-of-kin phone number under the name "ICE" in your cell phone. This is the universal name for "In Case of Emergency".\n\nMedical emergency: provide immediate medical care and call ambulance if necessary.\n\nThreats of Violence: violent incidents at school are not impulsive, random, or epidemic. Prior to most incidents the attacker told someone about his/her idea or plans. There is no accurate profile of a violent offender. Some, but not all violent students have social difficulties, and there are many motivations for violence. Prevention can be achieved by building a climate of trust and respect between students and adults. School should provide a place for open discussion where diversity and differences are allowed and communication is encouraged and supported. Attention must be paid to students\' social and emotional as well as academic needs.\n\nWhenever any threat is made, do not ignore them, and do not over-react. Threats of violence may be: direct- specific act against a specific target identified in a clear and explicit manner; indirect-vague, unclear, ambiguous or implied violence; veiled-implied but not explicitly a threat; conditional-warning of violence, if terms are not met (e.g., extortion). A professionally-trained threat assessment team may need to evaluate whether the threat\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nposes low, medium or high risk, considering student behavior, personality, school, social, and family dynamics.\n\n• If there is a suspicious or unknown persons. If you sense a threat, ask a colleague for immediate help. If you feel threatened trust your feelings. Keep distance. Use assertive verbal language and strong body language. Call police as necessary. Call for immediate lockdown if necessary.\n\n• If you encounter bullying. School culture should not tolerate bullying and anyone witnessing or experiencing bullying should feel comfortable reporting it and knowing that adults will follow up. Supportive family intervention may be needed for both victims and perpetrators of bullying. For more information see http:// www.stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/kids/\n\n• If there is a fight among students. Call or send someone to the office. You are not required to physically intervene. Identify yourself and instruct combatants to stop. Call them by name, instruct spectators to move away. Keep track of events for subsequent report. Dispatch staff to control and disperse onlookers.\n\n• If there is a person with a weapon. Call or send someone to office. You are not required to physically intervene. Try to remain calm. Try not to do anything that will provoke an active shooter. The threat may be high, medium or low risk depending on many factors. One staff member should call police and describe the situation: e.g., static (intruder barricaded somewhere) or dynamic (moving around), any injuries to staff or students, number, location and description of intruders. Also report suspicious devices, with description and location.\n\n• If there is a bomb threat. Stay calm. Keep caller on the line. Do not upset the caller. Indicate your willingness to cooperate. Do not pull fire alarm. Signal silently to co-workers to call police, immediately. Permit the caller to say as much as possible without interruption. Take notes on everything said including observation of background noise, voice characteristics, language, etc. Ask as many specific questions as possible. Upon hanging up immediately initiate caller ID if available. Speak with Police. Write everything down. Police will advise if building evacuation is necessary. If so, administration should announce building evacuation. Staff should make a visual check of classroom or immediate area. Anything suspicious should be reported immediately but not touched. School personnel should not handle, search for, or move a suspected bomb. Classroom teacher should evacuate immediate vicinity of any suspicious object. Do not use radios, walkie-talkies or cellular phones to avoid accidentally triggering an explosive device. Staff nearby should turn off stoves, equipment, and gas supply to building. Do not return to the building again until police, fire personnel or administration give the "all clear."\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• When you are in transit. When traveling to and from school, to reduce vulnerability to random acts of violence, staff and students should use well-travelled, open routes. Walk assertively and be alert to everything around you, and travel with a buddy or escort, especially at night. There may be some circumstances when authorities advise people to vary their routes, to avoid being targets of attack. Avoid dangers by getting away quickly. Scream loudly for help "Call the Police." A variety of professional and community security patrols may all be important to increasing personal safety.\n\nFire:\n\n• If you see a fire. Put out small fires with fire extinguisher or cover source of fuel with blanket. For modern fire extinguisher use, remember "P.A.S.S.": Pull safety pin from handle. Aim at base of the flame. Squeeze the trigger handle. Sweep from side to side at the base of the flame. Shut off source of fuel if safe to do so (e.g., gas). Activate fire alarm. Alert others. Call emergency telephone number and report location of fire. Evacuate building. Close doors and windows.\n\n• If you hear a fire alarm. Treat as a real emergency. Follow building evacuation procedures. Never open a closed door without checking first for heat. Do not open a hot door.\n\n• If you are caught in smoke. Drop down on knees and crawl out. Breathe shallowly through your nose. Hold breath as long as possible. Use damp cloth over mouth and nose.\n\n• If trapped in a room by fire. Block smoke from entering with damp cloth, under door. Retreat closing as many doors as possible. Signal and phone your location.\n\n• If a person or their clothing is on fire. Stop where you are. Drop to ground. Roll over. If another person is on fire, push them down, roll them and/or cover with blanket, rug or coat.\n\nEarthquake.\n\nDuring the shaking: at first indication of ground shaking, instruct loudly: "Earthquake position: Drop, Cover and Hold On." When the shaking is over, evacuate outdoors, away from the building.\n\n• In classrooms, the person closest to the door should open it fully. Anyone near an open flame should extinguish it. DROP down on your knees and make yourself as D\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nsmall a target as possible. COVER your head, neck and face. GO under a sturdy desk or table to protect your head and neck and as much of your body as possible. HOLD ON to your cover. Stay away from tall and heavy furniture or heavy equipment, and overhead hazards. Do not use elevators.\n\n• In a wheelchair, lock it and take the "brace position" covering head and neck. If in stadium seating, take the brace position in your seat.\n\n• In science labs and kitchens, extinguish burners and close hazardous materials containers and/or place out of harm\'s way before taking cover. Stay away from hot stove, overhead cabinets and from hazardous materials that may spill.\n\n• Inside in open areas, where no cover is available, move towards an interior wall and away from falling and overhead hazards. Drop, Cover and Hold, protecting you head and neck with your arms.\n\n• In library, workshops, performance areas and kitchen, move away from shelves, books and instruments if possible.\n\n• In stadium seating, take the "brace position" until the shaking stops. Follow ushers instructions for orderly evacuation.\n\n• Outdoors, move away from buildings, walls, power lines, trees, light poles and other hazards. Drop down to your knees and cover your head and neck.\n\n• In school transportation, driver should pull over and stop the vehicle, away from overhead hazards. Take the "brace position."\n\nDuring an aftershock, take the same protective measures as during the shaking.\n\nAfter the shaking stops, in case of moderate or severe earthquakes, before you exit your room, check around you for anyone injured. Administer life-saving first aid (open airway, stop serious bleeding, treat for shock). Ask responsible students to assist lightly injured. If a severely injured or trapped individual is inside, make them comfortable. Give them a whistle and comfort item and reassure them that search and rescue team will come for them. If staying would be dangerous, non-ambulatory injured should be transported with class. Put out any small fire. Take ten seconds to look around and make a mental note of damage and dangers to report. Mark your door with either green "All Out" sign or red "HELP!/ DANGER!" sign. Leave your doors unlocked. Check for safe exit routes and then carefully evacuate building, moving away from the building.\n\nTsunami. Evacuate in case of tsunami early warning, or felt-earthquake, to previously-selected safe haven at higher ground and away from coast.\n\nStorm. Follow early-warning instructions. Shelter-in-place.\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• If you are indoors, stay off all telephones. Telephone lines can conduct electricity. Unplug televisions, computers and other appliances. Lightning can cause power surges and travel through electric lines. Stay away from running water in faucets, sinks and bathtubs. Electricity from lightning can come inside through plumbing. Close window coverings, then stay away from windows. Listen to weather advisories on a battery-powered radio. Obey advisories promptly.\n\n• If you are outdoors, plan ahead. Know where you\'ll go if an unexpected thunderstorm develops. Monitor weather conditions and be prepared to take immediate action to get to a safe place before the thunderstorm arrives. If you are boating or swimming, get to land, get off the beach and find a safe place immediately. Stay away from water, which can conduct electricity from lightening. Go to safety in a permanent, closed structure, such as a reinforced building. If there are no reinforced structures, get into a car or bus, keeping windows closed. Keep your hands on your lap and feet off the floor. If you are in the woods, find an area protected by a low clump of trees. Never stand under a single, large tree in the open. As a last resort, go to a low-lying, open place. Stay away from tall things-trees, towers, fences, telephone poles, power lines. Be aware of the potential for flooding in low-lying areas.\n\n• If you feel or see lightening, (Note: if you feel your hair stand on end, lightning is about to strike.) squat low to the ground on the balls of your feet so that the charge can go through you back into the ground. Place your hands over your ears and bend your head down. Make yourself the smallest target possible. Do not lie flat on the ground!\n\n• If lightning strikes a person, call for help. Get someone to dial 9-1-1 or your local number for Emergency Medical Services (EMS). A person who has been struck by lightning needs medical attention as quickly as possible. Give first aid. If the person has stopped breathing, begin rescue breathing (if you are properly trained). If the person\'s heart has stopped beating, someone trained in CPR should administer it. Look and care for other possible injuries and check for burns. Move the victim to a safer place. Remember, people struck by lightning carry no electric charge, and they can be handled safely\n\nFlood. Follow early-warning instructions. Evacuate to higher ground or shelter-in-place.\n\n• Slow rise flooding: Given sufficient notice to evacuate prior to flooding, protect records and electronic equipment as best as possible. Take normal actions for building evacuation and proceed to safe haven.\n\n• Sudden severe flooding. Evacuate all affected spaces immediately. Relocate to a safe place on the upper floors of the building, taking Go Bucket or Bag and emer-\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\ngency notebook or clipboard with you. Do NOT try to wade through flood waters of any depth. Do NOT try to leave the building in a car. If you must evacuate, wear life-jackets or similar flotation devices.\n\nHazardous Materials Release. Evacuate upwind to safe haven or shelter-in-place, closing and sealing windows, air-ducts.\n\n• Chemical spills or suspicious materials. If possible, limit release at the source and contain the spill. Shut down equipment. Evacuate the immediate area. If danger extends beyond immediate area, pull fire alarm and follow the building evacuation and assembly procedure. First witness of the hazardous materials leak/spill: call emergency telephone number give details of materials and location, and number of people in the vicinity.\n\n• Gas leak. Do not pull fire alarm-this could cause an explosion. Leave the area and call emergency telephone number. Issue alert using public address system or door-to-door. Evacuate the building following building evacuation and assembly procedure.\n\n• Explosion. Drop and cover under desk, tables or other furniture that will protect you against flying glass and debris. When it is safe refer to the Emergency Call Section and immediately report an explosion. Leave doors open to permit exit, if building is damaged. Stay away from outside walls and areas where there are large pieces of glass and/or heavy suspended light fixtures. Standby for further instructions from your incident commander.\n\nResponse skills\n\nResponse skills associated with different roles in Incident Command Systems are described below. Many of your staff will already have some of the response skills described below. Many more skills can be learned from online self-study programs. You can also find training resources in your local community from fire department, civil defence, Red Cross or Red Crescent national society, and other resources. Make an annual staff training plan, to fill in any gaps in the response skills that you will need. Many schools have found that as staff acquire these skills and practice them during drills, they can pass them on to new staff through regular 30-minute, small-group training sessions.\n\nThe Incident Commander is responsible for directing emergency operations and shall remain at the Command Post ICC to observe and direct all operations. The IC will normally be the school principal, assistant principal or their designee. In the absence of the normal IC, anyone may assume the duties of the IC until someone more qualified can take over. Responsibilities include:\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\n• Begin and end emergency response;\n\n• Assess type and scope of emergency;\n\n• Determine threat to human life and structures and need for outside assistance;\n\n• Set up command post ("incident command center");\n\n• Set up and coordinate emergency assignments as needed.\n\nCommunications team responsibilities include:\n\n• Report to the Incident Commander;\n\n• Support Incident Commander by facilitating and delivering communications;\n\nEmergency Procedures Decision-Tree\n\nASSEMBLE & SHELTER OUTSIDE RAPID ONSET NO WARNING MEDIUM ONSET EARLY WARNING Violence RESUME CLASSES and/or Normal Release • Alarm signal • Call emergency # • Everyone inside! • Lock all doors • No entering or leaving • Signs in window • Account for students • Make shelter • Student care and supervision SHELTER-IN-PLACE (INDOORS)   DROP, COVER & HOLD ON if necessary EVACUATE TO SAFE HAVEN • Move to safer location • Account for students • Request transportation • Uses vehicles for shelter EMERGENCY STUDENT RELEASE • Release to verified and approved emergency contacts only • Document reunification details • Alarm or shake trigger • Fire: Call emergency # • Sweep building • Assist disabled & visito NO • Take Go-Supplies • Earthquake: Mark doo LOCKDOWN EVACUATE BUILDING I Earthquake DROP, COVER & HOLD ON DROP, COVER & HOLD ON CRAWL if necessary Is the building safe?

These same supplies will be needed if you have to shelter-in-place. The checklists provided in the Addenda recommend supplies to be maintained by administration, nursing office, in each classroom, and schoolwide.\n\nThe school administration office "go-box" should staff and student class roster and schedules, and for elementary and secondary schools it should contain Student Emergency Contact Cards, and student check-in and absentee log and daily visitors log, school site map, important phone numbers, keys, and office supplies.\n\nThe nursing office go-box should contain student prescription medications and first aid supplies. School first aid kit contents should be appropriate to the size of your school. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid_kit\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nEach classroom should have a classroom "go-bag" or "go-bucket." These "evacuation supplies" should be taken on field trips, and can also be used in case of lockdown or shelter-in-place (where the bucket can serve as a makeshift toilet). Each room will also need an emergency clipboard or notebook that can be hanging on a hook at the exit, or placed inside the "go-bag." This should be updated at the beginning of each school year and in preparation for school drills.\n\nStudent "comfort-bags" should be requested from parents and kept in a duffle bag or backpack in homeroom classes, ready at exit. Parent-teacher association may want to assist in assembling these items, particularly for those who many not be able to afford them. Parents can also be asked to donate one blanket per child to the school, which will be kept in the emergency supplies container (see below).\n\nSchool emergency supplies should be located in a container or bin, stored outside the main school buildings. The contents should include a supply of water (approximately 4 liters of water per person per day-half drinking, half sanitation). This may be used by the school or community, if the school is utilized as a shelter. It should include communication devices, and as needed, vests and hardhats for response team members, shelter supplies, WC privacy screen, and light search and rescue supplies if needed.\n\nResponse teams will need access to several copies of your disaster response team notebook containing school and assembly area maps, master list of students, faculty/staff roster, school disaster and emergency response matrix, incident command system responsibility notes, and basic and specific emergency procedures. Teams will also need access to table, chairs, desk supplies.\n\n4. Practicing, monitoring, and improving\n\nHold simulation drills to practice, reflect upon and update your plan\n\nSchool drills should be tailored to expected hazards. Every school should conduct at least 3 fire drills per year, and at least one full simulation drill. Schools in earthquake or flood prone areas should also practice for these hazards. For every drill that you perform with a prior announcement, be sure to perform one without a prior announcement. Try them with different scenarios, at different times of the day. Try them when the school principal is there and when he or she is not there. The purpose of a drill is to prepare for the unexpected, so if you make it too easy, you won\'t learn how to adapt to the real situation. Drills should always be treated as "the real thing."\n\nGood drills are a learning process. They begin with advance preparation by staff, providing an opportunity to train students in classroom groups, remember procedures, and check on provisions. The simulation itself is an experiential learning opportunity. Following\n\nSchool D isaster M anagem ent\n\nthe drill, students can debrief with teachers in the classroom. An "all school" faculty and staff meeting is an important way to debrief, and to discuss ways to improve upon both mitigation measures and response preparedness. The most important part of any drill is the discussion and the updated action plan that comes from the experience.\n\nMonitoring indicators for school disaster management\n\nThe School Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist (see Addenda) is offered to guide your reflection on your own progress in implementing school disaster management policies and procedures. It is most rewarding to use this at the beginning of your efforts, to establish your "baseline", and then to repeat this check once a year to measure your progress. These can also be used during preparation for and reflection after school drills, to focus your continuing efforts to ensure the safety of students and school personnel, and assure educational continuity.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\n41\n\nReferences\n\nGFDRR and INEE, Guidelines Notes on Safer School Construction, 2009. http://www.in-eesite.org/index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/\n\nInteragency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE), Minimum Standards Handbook (2010), http://www.ineesite.org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/.

Safe school buildings;\n\n2. Disaster prevention education;\n\n3. School disaster and emergency management.\n\nSafe school buildings is addressed in the GFDRR/INEE publication, Guidance Notes on Safer School Construction (2009), available in several languages: http://www.ineesite.org/ index.php/post/safer_school_construction_initiative/ or http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=10478.\n\nIn the project development process (new construction, retrofit, and/or remodeling) many of the most critical issues related to school site selection, design for hazard-resilience, and supervised construction should have been addressed. However, the sustainability of safety, the maintenance of school facilities, and the responsibility for educational continuity, rest squarely with the administration and authorities to whom the building is handed over.\n\nDisaster prevention education is addressed in the companion publication, Disaster and Emergency Preparedness: Activity Guide for K-6th Grade Teachers (IFC 2010) that provides suggested activities for introduction of basic disaster awareness and prevention at an age-appropriate level for primary school students. Integrating disaster prevention knowledge and action into students\' education at school is of critical importance to building a long-term and sustainable "culture of safety" http://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13988.\n\nThe subject of this handbook, school disaster and emergency preparedness, falls in the middle (yellow) sphere below. Emergency and Disaster Preparedness: Guidance for Schools(2010) is the area that is at the core of "sustainability" of comprehensive school safety. It addresses all of those risk reduction, preparedness and response issues that must be\n\nC\n\nom prehensive School Safety\n\naddressed and implemented at the local school level, by the school community. http://www. preventionweb.net/english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=13989.\n\nThere are also policy issues to be addressed by education authorities at all levels. The international Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies\' (INEE), Minimum Standards Handbook, for education in disasters, addresses emergencies from prevention through to recovery. They are designed to ensure that communities are meaningfully involved in the design and delivery of education programs in emergencies, that efforts are coordinated, accountable, and support the education sector in "building back better." http://www.ineesite. org/index.php/post/inee_minimum_standards_overview/. These are a companion to the SPHERE Project\'s Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response, http://www.sphereproject.org/.\n\nPolicy issues for education-sector decision-makers are also addressed in School Disaster Prevention: Guidance for Education Sector Decision-Makers (2008), http://www.preventionweb. net/english/professional/publications/v.php?id=7556 .\n\nRunning through the implementation of each of these objectives are the familiar themes of community participation, coordination, and accountability. These objectives are consistent with effective approaches to any social and environmental management system and are intended to extend these principles beyond the initial project stage, throughout the life of the institution.\n\nThis approach to comprehensive school safety follows from IFC\'s performance standards for all projects, especially to those objectives related to risk reduction, safe working conditions, and community health and safety. The guidance here is intended to complement recommendations for emergency plans for response and preparedness outlined in Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines. http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/sustainability.nsf/Content/ EHSGuidelines\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nSchool Disaster Readiness and Resilience Checklist\n\n1.

The drill will be based on a hypothetical scenario for a flood that occurs during the 5th day of rain, generates massive flood runoff when the river spills over its banks or floodgates are thrown open to prevent a dam burst. This is unlike anything experienced in the past 100 years. The principal has received a telephone call warning of the immanent flooding. If your building has 2 floors, your plan is to evacuate to the second floor. If your building has 1 floor, your plan is to evacuate to higher ground if time permits. Students have flotation jackets or belts for safety.\n\nHazardous materials exercise\n\n(Adapt and practice if you are located nearby production facilities that use hazardous materials). The drill will be based on a hypothetical scenario for an industrial hazardous materials release from a nearby factory. You have met with nearby industrial facilities operators and have learned the measures to take. You receive a siren. Telephone communication systems are working.\n\nD\n\nrill Scenarios\n\nOther variations\n\nTo make this a realistic simulation drill, you can add your own "injects." At the beginning and at any time during the drill you can make "new information" known, which provides challenges that participants must handle, just as they would in a real life situation.\n\nREMEMBER: every drill should be taken seriously. Every fire alarm should be responded to, as though it were real, as we do not know when it is a drill, and when it is real.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nDrill Preparedness Checklists\n\nTeacher checklist\n\nTeachers: Prepare yourselves\n\n�• School emergency evacuation route map is posted in your room. On it mark your room clearly in a contrasting color. If you do not have one, please obtain it from the school office.\n\n�• Emergency Go-Bag or Go-Bucket checklist, emergency notebook/clipboard checklists, and student comfort kits checklist are complete.\n\n�• All of these supplies are in place and are easily transportable for evacuation or field trips.\n\n�• Confirm whether you will have any special duties. Get to know your buddies in neighboring classes. If your name does not appear on our emergency organization matrix or if you do not have a class, please be prepared to report to the incident command center.\n\n�• Check that you know the location of your fire extinguisher and recall the acronym to remind you how to use it: P.A.S.S. Pull the pin, aim at the base of the fire, squeeze the nozzle and sweep at the base of the fire.\n\n�• It is highly recommended that you complete your own family disaster plan at home and your plan with your own childcare providers. Please prepare yourself at home and at work in the event you are needed to stay longer than your scheduled day. The principal or designee will release staff members as the needs change. If you have very extenuating circumstances discuss these with your principal NOW, not during an emergency.\n\n�• Plan a quiet activity that students can do in the assembly area in the event of a real emergency or a drill.\n\n�• In case of disaster before or soon after the end of the school day, please be prepared to return to school to provide assistance to students.\n\nTeachers: Prepare your students\n\n�• Encourage your students to take all drills very seriously.\n\n�• Practice building evacuation with your classroom and with neighboring classroom. Make sure that your students know the 4 rules for building evacuation: Don\'t Talk! Don\'t Push! Don\'t run! Don\'t turn back! Students should know that\n\nD\n\nrill Preparedness C hecklists\n\nif there is an earthquake when they are outside of a classroom (during break or lunch or if they are somewhere), they should exit with the nearest class and should NOT go back inside. If they are between classes, they should assemble in the outdoor emergency assembly area with their next period class.\n\n�• Review the emergency evacuation routes. Prepare 4 monitors who will work as buddies and lead the way, carefully checking to make sure that the route is clear. (This is of most importance for classes on second floor or without easy access to open space outdoors).\n\n�• If you face earthquake risks, practice "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" drill, having students hold their position for 45 seconds. You may count together: one-one hundred, two one-hundred etc.\n\n�• Teacher in science labs should demonstrate to students how to extinguish any flames and isolate any hazardous materials in use.\n\n�• Make sure that students understand disaster and emergency student release procedures. Inform students that only their parent(s), guardian(s), or other adult(s) listed on their emergency contacts card will be allowed to pick them up from school in a real emergency. Explain the "request gate"/"reunion gate" idea and reasons.\n\nTeachers and Students: Prepare your parents\n\n�• Teachers are to pass out drill announcements parent letters to their students to take home.\n\n�• Confirm with parents that their Emergency Contact Form is up-to-date, and explain the importance of the reunification procedures.\n\n�• Reassure parents that their children will be safe at school until they arrive.\n\nTransportation staff checklist\n\nTransportation staff: prepare yourself before an emergency.\n\n�• In the event of a major emergency, bus drivers\' first responsibility is the safety and welfare of the students. The driver will account for all students and staff throughout the emergency.\n\n�• First aid training is up-to-date.\n\n�• Emergency contact information for all students on my route is with me in my vehicle.\n\n�• Emergency medical information for students with disabilities or life-threatening illnesses is with me, in my vehicle.\n\nD\n\nis\n\nas\n\nte\n\nr\n\nan\n\nd\n\nEm\n\ner\n\nge\n\nnc\n\ny\n\nPr\n\nep\n\nar\n\ned\n\nne\n\nss\n\n:\n\nG\n\nui\n\nda\n\nnc\n\ne\n\nfo\n\nr\n\nSc\n\nho\n\nol\n\ns\n\nTransportation Staff: prepare your passengers.\n\n�• In areas with earthquake risk, we have practiced "Drop, Cover and Hold" and vehicle evacuation with your students.\n\n�• All passengers know that they must act in accordance with driver\'s instructions.\n\nTransportation Staff: prepare your parents and caregivers.\n\n�• Parents have been reminded that in case of emergency during the commute, I will take children to the nearest school.\n\nTransportation Staff: during earthquake shaking, I know that I will:\n\n�• Stop the bus away from power lines, bridges, overpasses, buildings, possible landslide conditions, overhanging trees, or other dangerous situations.

Observations from previous natural disasters suggest that skin, diarrheal, and respiratory infections are the most common infectious diseases in survivors. The etiologies of disease outbreaks are usually predictable, reflecting infectious diseases endemic in the affected area before the disaster. Injury and soft tissue infections are expected during the first few days after a disaster. In contrast, airborne, water-borne, and food-borne diseases are anticipated for up to one month after a disaster. A feared consequence of natural disasters is the potential exposure to dead bodies, both human and animal. No evidence exists that exposure to bodies after a disaster leads to infectious disease epidemics. To be discussed are specific epidemics that have followed earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and drought. Preventative public health and safety measures aimed at attenuation of such epidemics will be reviewed.\n</p><h3><p>Introduction\n</p></h3><p>A disaster has been defined as "a result of a vast ecological breakdown in the relation between humans and their environment, a serious or sudden event on such a scale that the stricken community needs extraordinary efforts to cope with it, often with outside help or international aid."1<b> </b> Such disasters may be natural disasters, transportation disasters, the result of terrorism or technological events, and pandemics. This article will focus on epidemics following natural disasters. Such disasters include earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and drought.\n</p><p>Much misunderstanding surrounds the potential for communicable diseases after disasters, with a widely held belief that epidemics are inevitable. This is partially due to an overestimation of the capacity for disease spread from dead bodies.2 In fact, the primary driver of disease spread after natural disasters is population displacement and crowding and its interplay with endemic disease and with a breakdown in infrastructure. If a disease is not endemic to a disaster area and is not introduced after a disaster, then it won\'t cause an epidemic after the event.2<b> </b>Factors contributing to disaster severity include human vulnerability due to poverty and social inequality, environmental degradation, and rapid population growth, especially among the poor.\n</p><p>Natural disasters have killed millions of people over the last twenty years, impacting the lives of at least one billion more people, and resulting in enormous economic damages.3 In the decade 1994-2004, there were approximately one million thunderstorms, 100,000 floods, tens of thousands of landslides, earthquakes, wildfires and tornadoes, and several thousand hurricanes, tropical cyclones, tsunamis, and volcanoes.3 Table 1 shows the relative risk of communicable diseases following specific disasters.\n</p><p>Because developing countries may lack resources, infrastructure, and disaster-preparedness systems, they may be disproportionately affected by natural disasters.4\n</p><p>Phases of natural disasters include an impact, post-impact, and recovery.5 The impact phase occurs from 0-4 days, during which extrication of victims and treatment of immediate soft tissue infections takes place. Hypothermia, heat, illness, and dehydration are characteristic of this phase. In the post- impact </p><h1><p>Epidemics After Natural Disasters\n</p></h1><h3><p>David M. Lemonick, MD, FAAEP, FACEP\n</p></h3><p><i>Based on a presentation at the 2011 AAPS Annual Scientific Meeting, Tysons Corner, VA, June 21-22\n</i></p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p> American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three </p></td><td><p><b>145\n</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>phase, which takes place from four days to four weeks post-disaster, airborne, foodborne, waterborne, and vector diseases are seen. Examples of diseases in this phase are cholera, bacterial dysentery, cryptosporidiosis, rotavirus, norovirus, salmonella, typhoid and paratyphoid, giardiasis, hepatitis A and E, and leptospirosis.<b> </b>Communicable respiratory infections in post-disaster settings include viral (e.g., influenza, RSV, adenoviruses), bacterial (e.g., <i>Strep pneumoniae</i>, pertussis, tuberculosis, Le-gionella, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>), and diseases transmitted via the respiratory route (e.g.<i>, </i>measles, varicella,<i> nisseria meningitides)</i>. Tetanus is also seen in this phase.\n</p><p><b>Table 1</b>: Risk of communicable diseases after disasters, by mode of transmission1\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b>DISASTER TYPE\n</b></p></td><td><p><b>PERSON-TO-PERSON*\n</b></p></td><td><p><b>WATERBORNE#\n</b></p></td><td><p><b>FOOD-BORNE+\n</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Volcano </p></td><td><p>Medium </p></td><td><p>Medium </p></td><td><p>Medium\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Earthquake </p></td><td><p>Medium </p></td><td><p>Medium </p></td><td><p>Medium\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hurricane </p></td><td><p>Medium </p></td><td><p>High </p></td><td><p>Medium\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tornado </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Heat wave </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cold wave </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Flood </p></td><td><p>Medium </p></td><td><p>High </p></td><td><p>Medium\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Famine </p></td><td><p>High </p></td><td><p>High </p></td><td><p>Medium\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Air pollution </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Industrial </p><p>accident\n</p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fire </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Radiation </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low </p></td><td><p>Low\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Civil war/ refugees\n</p></td><td><p>High </p></td><td><p>High </p></td><td><p>High\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>*Shigellosis, streptococcal skin infections, scabies, infectious hepatitis, pertussis, measles, diphtheria, other respiratory infections, giardiasis, HIV/AIDS, other sexually-transmitted diseases, meningococcal disease, plague.\n</p><p>#Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, cholera, leptospirosis, infectious hepatitis,<b> </b>shigellosis, campylobacter, salmonella, E. coli, cryptosporidiosis.\n</p><p>+ Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, cholera, infectious hepatitis, shigellosis, campylobacter, salmonella, E. coli, amebiasis, giardiasis, cryptosporidium.\n</p><p>The recovery phase begins after four weeks, and diseases with long incubation periods, vectorborne, and chronic diseases manifest in this phase. Examples of organisms with long incubation periods are leishmaniasis and leptospirosis. Vectorborne illnesses include malaria, western/Saint Louis encephalitis, dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. Chronic diseases seen in the recovery phase after hurricane Katrina, for example, included cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma.<b> </b>Special needs for shelters, wheelchairs, oxygen, large cots for the obese, glucometers, access to dialysis, and lacking prescription medications were also seen.5\n</p><p>Wound infections among survivors of the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia were polymicrobial, with over 600 organisms ultimately identified. Most prominent among these were <i>Aeromonas</i> species, <i>E.coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumonia</i>,<i> </i>and<i> Pseu-\n</i><i>domonas aeruginosa</i>. Some of these organisms were resistant to all licensed antibiotics.6 Among hurricane evacuees from the New Orleans area, a cluster of infections with methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) was reported in approximately 30 pediatric patients at one evacuee facility in Dallas, Texas.7 Additionally, 24 cases of hurricane-associated <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> and<i> V. parahaemolyticus</i> wound infections were reported, with six deaths.8\n</p><p>Among the factors that contribute to disease transmission after disasters are environmental considerations, endemic organisms, population characteristics and crowding, the pre-event structure and type of public health systems and facilities and levels of immunization, and the magnitude of the disaster itself.9 Environmental considerations include climate, with cold conditions favoring airborne pathogens and warm conditions favoring waterborne pathogens. In temperate climates, the winter is associated with influenza, while summer is a time for enterovirus infections. Similarly, rainfall during El Nino contributes to malaria, while drought leads to malnutrition-related disease.<b> </b>Geography may play a role in epidemics by isolating victims from needed resources. Organisms endemic to a region will be present after the disaster, while those that are not endemic before the event are unlikely to be present afterwards. On the other hand, as was demonstrated with the appearance of <i>Vibrio</i> infections after hurricane Katrina, the lack of reports of an organism prior to a disaster does not guarantee that the organism is not endemic.8 This phenomenon was also demonstrated by the appearance of enterotoxicogenic <i>Shigella dysenteria</i> type 1, <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i>, and hepatitis E, following disasters in Africa.9 As happened in Haiti with cholera, introduction of non-endemic organisms is possible when relief workers carry it to a disaster area. In fact, cholera has emerged as a serious disease in Latin America only in recent years.2 Examples of endemic disease outbreaks to a region will be present after the disaster, including a nine-fold increase in coccidiomycosis (Valley fever) from January- March 1994 after the Northridge, California, earthquake and the giardiasis outbreak in 1980 after the eruption of Mount St. Helens, Montana.9\n</p><p>Population characteristics include the density and age of victims and the preponderance of chronic diseases. Displaced populations may be crowded in refugee camps. Disease incidence is usually increased in the elderly and in the very young.<b> </b>Baseline immunity to specific diseases is another critical feature of populations. Floods in Nepal in 1973 and in Sudan in 1988 displaced hundreds of thousands of victims. Similarly, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 and hurricane Katrina resulted in mass displacement and temporary crowded shelter conditions for victims. Refugees living in crowded, temporary settings, of whom there may currently be over 50 million worldwide, are subject to explosive outbreaks of communicable disease of low endemicity, such as malaria, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. Most recently reported, the human immunodeficiency virus has affected almost 10% of refugee Sudanese men since their forced migration to Ethiopia.10\n</p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b>146\n</b></p></td><td><p>American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td> </td><td colspan="3"><p><b>WATERBORNE DISEASES: SUMMARY\n</b></p></td><td> </td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Disease </b></p></td><td><p><b>Clinical Features </b></p></td><td><p><b>Incubation Period </b></p></td><td><p><b>Diagnosis </b></p></td><td><p><b>Treatment\n</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cholera </p></td><td><p>profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting\n</p></td><td><p>2 hrs - 5 days </p></td><td><p>direct microscopic observation of V. cholerae in stool\n</p></td><td><p>rehydration therapy;

Another important population characteristic includes level of education, with less educated people tending to be less responsive to disaster teams.<b> </b>Religious beliefs may thwart public health efforts as was seen in the polio epidemic in Nigeria in 2004. The underlying health education and hygiene of the public and the types of trauma present (e.g., penetrating, blunt, burns) are also important population characteristics.\n</p><p>Critical pre-disaster variables include sanitation, primary health care and nutrition, medical infrastructure, equipment and medications, disaster preparedness, disease surveillance, and roads and transportation. The spread of microorganisms during a natural disaster is facilitated by disruption of public water and sewage systems, crowded living conditions, air borne transmission, lack of immunization, and injury-related infection due to exposure to debris.\n</p><p>The type of disaster can determine the variety of trauma and other post-disaster noninfectious illnesses. Earthquake, hurricane, and tsunami can lead to crush injury and other penetrating injuries. Tsunami and floods lead to near-drowning and electrocution. Floods cause about 50% of all deaths from natural disasters in the United States.9 The majority of these are due to vehicle-related drowning during flash floods. Flooding also leads to carbon monoxide exposure and death.\n</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common causes of death in a disaster are diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and malnutrition.11\n</p><h3><p>Diseases Associated with Natural Disasters\n</p></h3><p>Diseases associated with natural disasters can be divided generally into those associated with overcrowding, waterborne diseases, vectorborne diseases, and other diseases (Table 2).<b> </b>Crowding after disasters has contributed to epidemics of acute respiratory illness and pneumonia, measles, and meningitis.<b> </b>Evacuation to camps following natural disasters is prone to lead to infectious diseases. Camps combine high population density and poor sanitation, synergistic preconditions for fecal-oral and airborne droplet transmission of disease.12\n</p><p>These illnesses are spread person-to-person by airborne droplet transmission. A measles outbreak followed the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, in 1991. Most of the more than 100,000 displaced persons were members of the Aeta tribe that lived on the slopes of the volcano. More than 18,000 cases of measles were reported within two months of the eruption, with a 25% mortality rate. Since that time, fewer cases of measles have followed natural disasters, as immunization has been more widespread.\n</p><p>Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are a significant contributor to death and disability after disasters, and children less than five are affected disproportionately.4 Respiratory pathogens in post-disaster settings include viral (influenza, RSV, adenoviruses), bacterial (<i>Strep pneumoniae</i>, pertussis, tuberculosis, Legio-nella, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>), and diseases transmitted via the respiratory route <i>(</i>measles, varicella<i>, nisseria meningitides)</i>.<b> </b>Among reported illnesses after Hurricane Katrina, the proportion of ARI was 12% four days after the levee overflowed and 20% during the next four weeks.9 </p><p>Exposure to open-flame cooking, malnutrition, and lack of access to health care and antibiotics contribute to morbidity and mortality from ARI. ARI was responsible for most of the deaths among survivors of the tsunami in Aceh in 2004.11 The incidence of ARI quadrupled in Nicaragua in the month following Hurricane Mitch in 1998.13 Aspiration pneumonia is seen after flooding and tsunamis and is due to inhalation of soil-contaminated salt water. "Tsunami Lung" is a syndrome of cavitary lung disease and brain abscess seen among Southeast Asia tsunami survivors. It is initiated by the aspiration of soil, sand, and other particulate matter as a consequence of near-drowning. The syndrome is a polymicrobial pneumonia process that occurs up to six weeks later. Identified pathogens include water-borne organisms <i>Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Streptococcal </i>species<i>, Nocardia, Pseudallescheria boydi, </i>and<i> Burkholderia pseudomallei.</i>9,14\n</p><p>Flooding constitutes approximately 40% of natural disasters, and it promotes both waterborne and vectorborne diseases.11<b> </b>Upper respiratory infections and pneumonias were reported among multiple victims of hurricane Katrina, including a case of pertussis in a two-month-old infant who was rescued from a rooftop in New Orleans and evacuated to Tennessee. Appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis was provided, and no additional cases were reported.7,15\n</p><p>Waterborne diseases include diarrheal pathogens, hepatitis, and leptospirosis. Several pathogens have been associated with diarrhea after disasters. <i>Vibro cholerae</i> and enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> have been isolated after flooding in West Af-rica. Diarrheal diseases have followed hurricanes and flooding in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Nepal and are the most lethal public health threat to refugees overall.2 Over 70% of deaths among Kurdish refugees in 1991 were due to diarrheal disease. The cholera epidemic that followed the 2010 Haiti earthquake sickened more than 170,000 people and killed more than 3,600.14 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that the form of cholera detected in Haiti is one that is typically found in South Asia and Africa.15 The Haitian outbreak originated from contaminated water near a facility that housed Nepalese troops, who are thought to have introduced the strain to an immunologically naïve local population. From Haiti, several new cases were identified in previously unaffected regions.\n</p><p>The Dominican Republic detected its first case of cholera in a migrant worker who had returned home from Haiti after the outbreak there. Additional cases of cholera have since been </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><b>148\n</b></p></td><td><p>American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>reported in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Subsequently, confirmed imported cases have been reported in Florida. The CDC has reported 13 suspected imported cases, with five confirmed as of De-cember 2010. Researchers estimate that an additional 200,000 cases of cholera could arise in the Caribbean within the next 18 months.15\n</p><p>Paratyphoid fever, caused by <i>E Salmonella enterica</i> serotype Paratyphi A, resulted in diarrhea outbreaks in Indonesia in 1992-1993. <i> Cryptosporidium parvum</i>-related diarrhea followed flooding in Indonesia in 2001-2003.16 An outbreak of diarrheal diseases after flooding in Bangladesh in 2004 involved more than 17,000 cases of <i>V.Cholerae</i> and <i>E.Coli</i> infections.16 All survivors of the December 2004 tsunami in Aceh province in 2004 were forced to drink from unprotected wells, and 85% of these residents who were studied reported diarrhea.11 The risk of diarrheal disease outbreaks following natural disaster is higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries.<b> </b>The association of communicable diseases with malnutrition is well known. In many of these malnourished victims, diseases such as measles, malaria, ARI, and diarrheal diseases are the most common causes of death.\n</p><p>After Hurricanes Allison and Katrina, initial reports were that <i>Escherichia coli</i> counts were 100 times higher than those normally found in river runoff<i>. </i>Among the 24,000 Katrina evacuees who were housed in the Reliant Park building in the Hous-ton Astrodome complex, 18% developed acute gastroenteritis from September 2-12, 2005. Approximately 25% of adult and 40% of pediatric medical visits during this time were due to GI illness. Secondary spread to shelter and medical staff also occurred. While 50% of specimens were positive for norovi-rus, no other pathogen was identified.9,17 Clusters of diarrheal disease were reported among persons in evacuation centers in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. In Louisi-ana, approximately 20 clusters of diarrheal illness in evacuation centers were reported to and investigated by the CDC. In Memphis, gastrointestinal illness was the most common acute disease complaint among evacuees. Approximately 1,000 cases of diarrhea and vomiting were reported among evacuees in Mississippi and Texas. Norovirus was detected in stool specimens from patients in Texas. Nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i>, nontoxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> O1, and other infections were also identified. No confirmed cases of <i>Shigella</i> dysentery or typhoid fever were reported in evacuees, and by three weeks after the initial relocations following Katrina few additional cases of diarrheal disease were being reported.7,8 Following the 1976 Friuli, Italy, earthquake, there was a five- to sixfold increase in Salmonella secondary to food contamination, poor hygiene, and overcrowding.9\n</p><p>Following Hurricane Katrina, an increase in mortality was reported by CDC from <i>Vibrio</i><b> (</b><i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> and <i>parahae-molyticus</i>) soft tissue infections. Sixty percent of cases were wound infections and 40% resulted from eating raw shell-f</p><p>ish. Necrotizing complicated some cases, and overall <i>Vibrio</i> mortality was 40%, and it was 20% in the subset with <i>Vibrio</i> from wounds. <i>Vibrio parahemolyticus</i> cases after Katrina were mostly diarrhea, while <i>V. vulnificus</i> cases were mostly septicemia and wound infection, and very few were diarrhea. For those two species, secondary transmission is not seen. During the flooding following Katrina, <i>Vibrio</i> cases were also reported in Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana. These were mostly in im-muno-compromised, chronically ill people who were exposed seawater. Once contact with brackish seawater ceased, case reports ended and so did any apparent epidemic potential.8,16,17\n</p><p>In most refugee settings, the case fatality rates (CFR) for cholera are between 2-5%. In the 1994 Rwandan refugees in the Zairian town of Goma (now Republic of the Congo), the rate rose to almost 25%, with almost 90% of adult deaths due to diarrheal illness. This outbreak, which has come to be known as "The Great Lakes Disaster," caused at least 48,000 cases and 23,000 deaths within one month in the refugee camps in Goma, Zaire. Shigella also erupted. Shigella dysenteria type 1, seen in displaced African populations, has a CFR of 10% in young children and in the elderly. Following Hurricane Mitch in 1998, cholera outbreaks occurred in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Belize.4,5,6\n</p><p>The fecal-oral route (Tables 2 and 3) spreads Hepatitis A, B, and E. Usually infection results from drinking contaminated water, and there is current debate about the role of person-to-person spread. Hepatitis A and B are endemic in most developing countries, so children in these areas develop immunity to it early in life. In hepatitis E-endemic areas, generally mild disease outbreaks have followed flooding. Hepatitis E has only recently been introduced in most parts of Africa, so adults are unlikely to have immunity to it. Thus, any hepatitis-like illness in this region is assumed to be hepatitis E. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable, however, with mortality as high as 25%. Both hepatitis A and hepatitis E were noted in Aceh after the December 2004 tsunami and after the Pakistan earthquake in 2005. An increase in hepatitis A followed the 1983 Popaya, Columbia earthquake.9\n</p><p>Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that is spread by contact with contaminated water. Rodents shed the organisms in their urine, and contact of the skin and mucous membranes with contaminated water, soil, or vegetation. Several floods in the last decade were followed by leptospirosis outbreaks, notably in Taiwan after Typhoon Nali in 2001, in Mumbai after flooding in 2000, in Portugal in 1967, and Brazil in 1975.4\n</p><p>Measles incidence and spread transmission after a disaster depends upon the baseline immunization rate of the affected population, especially those under15 years of age. More than 18,000 measles cases occurred after the eruption of Mount Pi-natubo in the Philippines in 1991.18 Increased death rates from measles were reported in camps in Bangladesh (1978), Somalia (1980), Sudan (1985), Ethiopia (1987), Malawi (1988-1990), Mozambique (1988-89, 1991), Philippines (1991), Darfur, Somalia (1994), Haripur, Afghanistan, and Kakuma refugee </p><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p> American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three </p></td><td><p><b>149\n</b></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>camps, Kenya (2005). CFR of 2.3% up to 32% were reported.9<b> </b>Crowded living conditions, as is common among people displaced by natural disasters, contributes to rapid transmission of the organism.12 Also contributing to measles outbreaks is a low baseline vaccination coverage rate among the affected population and, in particular, among children aged &lt;15 years.<b> </b>These conditions that facilitate transmission are also ones that necessitate higher immunization coverage levels to prevent outbreaks. <i>Neisseria meningitidis </i>outbreaks<i> </i>have followed flooding and displacement in Pakistan and Aceh. <i>Meningococcal meningitis</i> outbreaks occurred also in refugees in Thailand in 1979, and among displaced Sudanese in1988, in Khartoum.9,16 Rapid response with antimicrobial prophylaxis interrupts transmission in disaster-affected populations.\n</p><p>Important vectorborne diseases following disasters include malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, all of which are transmitted by mosquitoes. Disruption of water supplies promoting standing water, especially when associated with large numbers of displaced people sleeping outside, contributes to outbreaks. Months of severe flooding in Bolivia in 2007 triggered a dengue outbreak that killed 35 people. A dramatic rise in malaria cases followed the 1991 earthquake in Costa Rica, associated with changes in habitat that promoted mosquito breeding. Over 75,000 cases of <i>Plasmodium falci-parum</i> malaria were associated with the 1966 Haitian hurricane Flora.17 Malaria-specific mortality is especially severe in situations in which refugees fleeing an area of low endemicity travel through or migrate to an area of high endemicity.2 Outbreaks of louse-borne relapsing fever were seen after refugee concentration in Somalia and Ethiopia.\n</p><p>Other diseases that are seen after disasters are tetanus and coc-cidiomycosis. Spores of <i>C. tetani</i> reside in soil, entering the tissue in contaminated wounds, especially in populations where vaccination levels are low. Once in the wounds, the spores produce a metalloprotease, tetanospasmin, which travels by retrograde movement into the central nervous system. There, the toxin blocks neurotransmission and disinhibits the motor cortex, leading to extensive spasm. Contributing to the occurrence of tetanus after disasters are penetrating injury with spore delivery, co-infection with other bacteria, localized tissue ischemia, and devitalized tissue. An outbreak of tetanus peaked two and one-half weeks after the tsunami in Aceh. The 106 cases that were reported from December 30 - January 26, 2004,<b> </b>occurred in Banda Aceh 4-30 days post-tsunami. CFR for this outbreak was 18.9%.9 The infection is not transmitted person to person. <i>Coccidioides immitis</i> is a fungus that is found in soil in certain semiarid areas. Coccidiomycosis (valley fever) can be associated with exposure to increased levels of airborne dust after landslides and earthquakes. An outbreak occurred after the 1994 earthquake in Southern California. Large dust clouds generated by the earthquake dispersed the spores of Coccidioi-des. The disease incidence peaked two weeks after the earthquake, and there was a ninefold increase in coccidiodomycosis from January-March 1994. Two hundred and three cases were reported in Ventura County, California, including three deaths.<b> </b>There were 30 cases per 100,000 population. Fifty-six percent of the cases and the highest attack rate (114 / 100,000) was in the town of Simi Valley, at the base of a mountain range that had numerous landslides associated with the earthquake. Risk was associated with being within, and amount of time spent in, the dust cloud.\n</p><p>While tuberculosis (TB) is not a disease that is associated with natural disasters, it has emerged as a disease among displaced populations. Inadequate access to healthcare among refugees has resulted in an increased spread of TB among them.19 During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991 and during the civil war and famine in Somalia in 1991-92, the incidence of TB increased four-fold.2 In 1985, 26% of deaths among refugees in Somalia were attributable to TB. Co-infection with HIV and malnutrition also contribute to the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of TB in displaced peoples. Control of TB among evacuees has consisted of both detecting new cases and providing treatment continuity for previously known cases.\n</p><p>Immediately after hurricane Katrina, TB program staff sought out known TB patients to check their status and assure that therapy continued. As of September 23, 2004, all 27 currently known TB patients who resided in Alabama, all 21 in Missis-sippi, and 105 (71%) of 147 in Louisiana had been located.<b> </b>Of the 42 TB patients from Louisiana not yet located, 41 were considered noncontagious at the time the hurricane made landfall.19 A homeless person without a previous diagnosis of TB who was evacuated from New Orleans to Philadelphia was identified with symptoms consistent with pulmonary TB. The patient was isolated and begun on treatment for TB disease; a subsequent culture confirmed TB. At least eight other evacuees initially identified as potentially having TB were subsequently determined to have other conditions (e.g., lung cancer and infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria).7,17,19\n</p><h3><p>Diagnosis of Communicable Diseases\n</p></h3><p>The diagnosis of waterborne, vectorborne, and direct contact diseases is summarized in Table 2. Diagnosis of cholera is made by the direct microscopic observation of the <i>V. cholerae</i> organisms in the stool of victims. Leptospira and hepatitis are detected by specific IgM serologic assays and by detecting anti-HAV or anti-HEV IgM antibodies, respectively. Typhoid is identified by culturing <i>Salmonella typhi</i> from blood, bone marrow, and bowel fluids, and by rapid antibody tests.\n</p><p>The etiology of ARI is often suggested by the clinical presentation, and culture of respiratory secretions may identify a specific pathogen, such as <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> or <i>Haemophi-lus influenzae</i>.\n</p><p border="1">Measles is generally diagnosed by its clinical features, while the etiology of meningitis is made by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. In the case of vectorborne diseases, parasites are identified on blood smear and serum antibody testing with </p><p><b>150\n</b></p><p border="1"></p><p>American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three</p><p border="1"></p><p>ELISA. A rapid dot-blot technique may be used in suspected dengue. Serologic assays are available for detecting IgM specific antibodies in Japanese encephalitis in CSF or blood.<b> </b>Similarly, serological assay is used for detection of yellow fever virus antibodies.\n</p><h3><p>The Significance of Dead Bodies\n</p></h3><p>There is a widely held fear that the presence of dead bodies after a disaster contributes to disease transmission. This potential is vastly overstated.4 In reality, when death is directly due to the natural disaster, human remains pose no risk for outbreaks.<b> </b>There are a few specific circumstances in which dead bodies pose any risks, such as deaths from cholera21-24 or hemorrhagic fevers.22 It is recommended that workers who handle bodies employ universal precautions for blood and body fluids and that they use and correctly dispose of gloves. Hand washing with soap after handling bodies and before eating and use of body bags are also important. Except in cases of cholera, shigellosis, or hemorrhagic fever, bodies do not need disinfection before disposal, but disinfection of vehicles and equipment is suggested. In addition, burial, rather than cremation, is recommended, with the bottom of graves above the water table (Table 3).4,20-23\n</p><h3><p>Disease Control after Disasters\n</p></h3><p>An accurate risk assessment for communicable diseases after a disaster is required in order to identify existing epidemic and endemic diseases that are common in the affected area. Similarly, the living conditions of the affected population are evaluated, with special attention to the availability of safe water and adequate sanitation facilities. Also assessed are the age distribution, nutritional status, and immunization coverage of those affected and their degree of access to healthcare.\n</p><p>Prevention and control of disease begins with hand washing, with proper handling of water and food, and with sewage disposal. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is initiated for diarrheal illness. Where possible, victims and aid workers must avoid entering contaminated water. Preventive Health Measures against the transmission of infectious agents related to natural disasters have been addressed by the WHO.11 WHO recommends: keep hands and vessels clean, avoid preparing food directly in areas surrounded by flood water, separate raw and cooked food, cook food thoroughly, keep food at safe temperatures, use safe water, wear appropriate protective clothing during rescue and cleanup operations, and immunization.\n</p><p>Hepatitis and polyvalent <i>Strep pneumonia</i> vaccination may be appropriate. In the event of measles, rapid mass vaccination should be instituted within 72 hours of an initial case report, and vitamin A is administered in children six months to five years of age to prevent complications and to reduce mortality.<b> </b>Rapid mass vaccination is also instituted for meningitis.\n</p><p>Malaria response includes mosquito control, provision of insecticide-treated nets, bedding, and clothing, and the emptying of standing water containers. In the case of dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, mosquito control, isolation of cases, and mass vaccination are implemented.\n</p><p><b>Table 4</b>: Recommended Handling of Dead Bodies11\n</p><p><b>SUGGESTED MEASURES FOR HANDLING DEAD BODIES\n</b></p><p>Universal precautions for blood and body fluids.

Cutler lecture reference.\n</p><h3><p>Conclusions\n</p></h3><p>Natural disasters have killed millions of people during the past two decades and have adversely affected the lives of over one billion others. These events include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, floods, and drought. Because of their lack of resources, infrastructure, and emergency medical and disaster systems, developing countries are disproportionately affected by natural disasters.\n</p><p>The potential for such disasters to be followed by epidemics of communicable diseases is often presumed to be very high, but this has been overstated (Table 5).<b> </b> In particular, the contribution of dead bodies in epidemic spread after disasters has been vastly exaggerated. In fact, dead bodies are not a significant contributor to disease. Rather, increases in the risk of communicable disease transmission has been demonstrated to be dependent upon: 1) the size, health status, and living conditions of the population displaced by the disaster; 2) crowding; 3) inadequate water and sanitation; and 4) poor access to health services. These factors are also characteristic of sudden population displacement in general.2\n</p><p>An understanding of epidemics after natural disasters has led to improved detection of, and response to, communicable diseases in these settings. By monitoring the incidence of such diseases and by documenting their impact, it is possible to better quantify the risk of outbreaks following natural disasters. Thus, by preparation for the inevitable, medical, epidemiological, and disaster response personnel will be more able to ameliorate the suffering that will occur after future natural disasters.\n</p><p><i>David Lemonick, MD, is Attending Emergency Physician, Arm-strong County Medical Center, Kittanning, PA, and President-Elect of the American Academy of Emergency Physicians.\n</i></p><p><i>Potential Financial Conflicts of Interest: By AJCM</i>®<i> policy, all authors are required to disclose any and all commercial, financial, and other relationships in any way related to the subject of this article that might create any potential conflict of interest.

  text: 'no title\n\n144 American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three\n\nAbstract\n\nEpidemics of infectious disease are rare following natural disasters, especially in developed countries. Observations from previous natural disasters suggest that skin, diarrheal, and respiratory infections are the most common infectious diseases in survivors. The etiologies of disease outbreaks are usually predictable, reflecting infectious diseases endemic in the affected area before the disaster. Injury and soft tissue infections are expected during the first few days after a disaster. In contrast, airborne, water-borne, and food-borne diseases are anticipated for up to one month after a disaster. A feared consequence of natural disasters is the potential exposure to dead bodies, both human and animal. No evidence exists that exposure to bodies after a disaster leads to infectious disease epidemics. To be discussed are specific epidemics that have followed earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and drought. Preventative public health and safety measures aimed at attenuation of such epidemics will be reviewed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA disaster has been defined as "a result of a vast ecological breakdown in the relation between humans and their environment, a serious or sudden event on such a scale that the stricken community needs extraordinary efforts to cope with it, often with outside help or international aid."1  Such disasters may be natural disasters, transportation disasters, the result of terrorism or technological events, and pandemics. This article will focus on epidemics following natural disasters. Such disasters include earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and drought.\n\nMuch misunderstanding surrounds the potential for communicable diseases after disasters, with a widely held belief that epidemics are inevitable. This is partially due to an overestimation of the capacity for disease spread from dead bodies.2 In fact, the primary driver of disease spread after natural disasters is population displacement and crowding and its interplay with endemic disease and with a breakdown in infrastructure. If a disease is not endemic to a disaster area and is not introduced after a disaster, then it won\'t cause an epidemic after the event.2 Factors contributing to disaster severity include human vulnerability due to poverty and social inequality, environmental degradation, and rapid population growth, especially among the poor.\n\nNatural disasters have killed millions of people over the last twenty years, impacting the lives of at least one billion more people, and resulting in enormous economic damages.3 In the decade 1994-2004, there were approximately one million thunderstorms, 100,000 floods, tens of thousands of landslides, earthquakes, wildfires and tornadoes, and several thousand hurricanes, tropical cyclones, tsunamis, and volcanoes.3 Table 1 shows the relative risk of communicable diseases following specific disasters.\n\nBecause developing countries may lack resources, infrastructure, and disaster-preparedness systems, they may be disproportionately affected by natural disasters.4\n\nPhases of natural disasters include an impact, post-impact, and recovery.5 The impact phase occurs from 0-4 days, during which extrication of victims and treatment of immediate soft tissue infections takes place. Hypothermia, heat, illness, and dehydration are characteristic of this phase. In the post- impact\n\nEpidemics After Natural Disasters\n\nDavid M. Lemonick, MD, FAAEP, FACEP\n\nBased on a presentation at the 2011 AAPS Annual Scientific Meeting, Tysons Corner, VA, June 21-22\n\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three 145\n\nphase, which takes place from four days to four weeks post-disaster, airborne, foodborne, waterborne, and vector diseases are seen. Examples of diseases in this phase are cholera, bacterial dysentery, cryptosporidiosis, rotavirus, norovirus, salmonella, typhoid and paratyphoid, giardiasis, hepatitis A and E, and leptospirosis. Communicable respiratory infections in post-disaster settings include viral (e.g., influenza, RSV, adenoviruses), bacterial (e.g., Strep pneumoniae, pertussis, tuberculosis, Le-gionella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and diseases transmitted via the respiratory route (e.g., measles, varicella, nisseria meningitides). Tetanus is also seen in this phase.\n\nTable 1: Risk of communicable diseases after disasters, by mode of transmission1\n\nDISASTER TYPE PERSON-TO-PERSON* WATERBORNE# FOOD-BORNE+\n\nVolcano Medium Medium Medium\n\nEarthquake Medium Medium Medium\n\nHurricane Medium High Medium\n\nTornado Low Low Low\n\nHeat wave Low Low Low\n\nCold wave Low Low Low\n\nFlood Medium High Medium\n\nFamine High High Medium\n\nAir pollution Low Low Low\n\nIndustrial accident Low Low Low\n\nFire Low Low Low\n\nRadiation Low Low Low\n\nCivil war/ refugees High High High\n\n*Shigellosis, streptococcal skin infections, scabies, infectious hepatitis, pertussis, measles, diphtheria, other respiratory infections, giardiasis, HIV/AIDS, other sexually-transmitted diseases, meningococcal disease, plague.\n\n#Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, cholera, leptospirosis, infectious hepatitis, shigellosis, campylobacter, salmonella, E. coli, cryptosporidiosis.\n\n+ Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, cholera, infectious hepatitis, shigellosis, campylobacter, salmonella, E. coli, amebiasis, giardiasis, cryptosporidium.\n\nThe recovery phase begins after four weeks, and diseases with long incubation periods, vectorborne, and chronic diseases manifest in this phase. Examples of organisms with long incubation periods are leishmaniasis and leptospirosis. Vectorborne illnesses include malaria, western/Saint Louis encephalitis, dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. Chronic diseases seen in the recovery phase after hurricane Katrina, for example, included cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. Special needs for shelters, wheelchairs, oxygen, large cots for the obese, glucometers, access to dialysis, and lacking prescription medications were also seen.5\n\nWound infections among survivors of the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia were polymicrobial, with over 600 organisms ultimately identified. Most prominent among these were Aeromonas species, E.coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Pseu- domonas aeruginosa. Some of these organisms were resistant to all licensed antibiotics.6 Among hurricane evacuees from the New Orleans area, a cluster of infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported in approximately 30 pediatric patients at one evacuee facility in Dallas, Texas.7 Additionally, 24 cases of hurricane-associated Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus wound infections were reported, with six deaths.8\n\nAmong the factors that contribute to disease transmission after disasters are environmental considerations, endemic organisms, population characteristics and crowding, the pre-event structure and type of public health systems and facilities and levels of immunization, and the magnitude of the disaster itself.9 Environmental considerations include climate, with cold conditions favoring airborne pathogens and warm conditions favoring waterborne pathogens. In temperate climates, the winter is associated with influenza, while summer is a time for enterovirus infections. Similarly, rainfall during El Nino contributes to malaria, while drought leads to malnutrition-related disease. Geography may play a role in epidemics by isolating victims from needed resources. Organisms endemic to a region will be present after the disaster, while those that are not endemic before the event are unlikely to be present afterwards. On the other hand, as was demonstrated with the appearance of Vibrio infections after hurricane Katrina, the lack of reports of an organism prior to a disaster does not guarantee that the organism is not endemic.8 This phenomenon was also demonstrated by the appearance of enterotoxicogenic Shigella dysenteria type 1, Neisseria meningitidis, and hepatitis E, following disasters in Africa.9 As happened in Haiti with cholera, introduction of non-endemic organisms is possible when relief workers carry it to a disaster area. In fact, cholera has emerged as a serious disease in Latin America only in recent years.2 Examples of endemic disease outbreaks to a region will be present after the disaster, including a nine-fold increase in coccidiomycosis (Valley fever) from January- March 1994 after the Northridge, California, earthquake and the giardiasis outbreak in 1980 after the eruption of Mount St. Helens, Montana.9\n\nPopulation characteristics include the density and age of victims and the preponderance of chronic diseases. Displaced populations may be crowded in refugee camps. Disease incidence is usually increased in the elderly and in the very young. Baseline immunity to specific diseases is another critical feature of populations. Floods in Nepal in 1973 and in Sudan in 1988 displaced hundreds of thousands of victims. Similarly, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 and hurricane Katrina resulted in mass displacement and temporary crowded shelter conditions for victims. Refugees living in crowded, temporary settings, of whom there may currently be over 50 million worldwide, are subject to explosive outbreaks of communicable disease of low endemicity, such as malaria, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. Most recently reported, the human immunodeficiency virus has affected almost 10% of refugee Sudanese men since their forced migration to Ethiopia.10\n\n146 American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three\n\n  WATERBORNE DISEASES: SUMMARY  \n\nDisease Clinical Features Incubation Period Diagnosis Treatment\n\nCholera profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting 2 hrs - 5 days direct microscopic observation of V. cholerae in stool rehydration therapy; antimicrobials\n\nLeptospirosis sudden onset fever, headache, chills, vomiting, severe myalgia 2 - 28 days leptospira- specific IgM serological assay penicillin, amoxi, doxyxycline, erythromycin, cephalosporins\n\nHepatitis jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, fever, fatigue and loss of appetite 15 - 50 days serological assay detecting anti- HAV of anti-HEV IgM antibodies supportive care; hospitalize/ barrier nursing for severe cases; monitoring of pregnant women\n\nBacillary dysentery malaise, fever, vomiting, blood and mucous in stool 12 - 96 hrs suspect if bloody diarrhea, confirm by isolation of organism nalidixic acid, ampicillin; hospitalize seriously ill or malnourished; rehydration\n\nTyphoid fever sustained fever, headache, constipation 3 - 14 days culture from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluids; rapid antibody tests ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin\n\nVECTORBORNE DISEASES: SUMMARY\n\nMalaria fever, chills, sweats, head and body aches, nausea and vomiting 7 - 30 days parasites on blood smear observed using a microscope; rapid diagnostic assays if available chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine\n\nDengue sudden onset severe flu- like illness, high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and rash 4 - 7 days Serum antibody testing with ELISA or rapid dot-blot technique intensive supportive therapy\n\nJapanese encephalitis quick onset, headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, tremors 5 - 15 days serological assay for JE virus IgM specific antibodies in CSF or blood (acute phase) intensive supportive therapy\n\nYellow fever fever, backache, headache, nausea, vomiting; toxic phase-jaundice, abdominal pain, kidney failure 3 - 6 days serological assay for yellow fever virus antibodies intensive supportive therapy\n\nDIRECT CONTACT DISEASES: SUMMARY\n\nPneumonia cough, difficulty breathing, fast breathing, chest indrawing 1 - 3 days Clinical presentation; culture respiratory secretions co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, ampicillin,\n\nMeasles rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes; serious post-measles complications (5-10% of cases) - diarrhea, pneumonia, croup 10 - 12 days generally made by clinical observation supportive care; nutrition/ hydration; vitamin A; control fever; antibiotics in complicated cases\n\nBacterial meningitis Sudden onset fever, rash, neck stiffness; altered consciousness; bulging fontanelle in <1 yrs of age 5 - 15 days Examination of CSF - elevated WCC, protein; gram negative diplococci Penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, co-trimoxazole; diazepam (seizures)\n\nTetanus difficulty swallowing, lockjaw, muscle rigidity, spasms 3 - 21 days entirely clinical immune globulin\n\nTable 2: Waterborne, Vectorborne, and Direct Contact Diseases26\n\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three 147\n\nMalnutrition, diabetes, and heart disease among victims also make them more vulnerable to infections. Another important population characteristic includes level of education, with less educated people tending to be less responsive to disaster teams. Religious beliefs may thwart public health efforts as was seen in the polio epidemic in Nigeria in 2004. The underlying health education and hygiene of the public and the types of trauma present (e.g., penetrating, blunt, burns) are also important population characteristics.\n\nCritical pre-disaster variables include sanitation, primary health care and nutrition, medical infrastructure, equipment and medications, disaster preparedness, disease surveillance, and roads and transportation. The spread of microorganisms during a natural disaster is facilitated by disruption of public water and sewage systems, crowded living conditions, air borne transmission, lack of immunization, and injury-related infection due to exposure to debris.\n\nThe type of disaster can determine the variety of trauma and other post-disaster noninfectious illnesses. Earthquake, hurricane, and tsunami can lead to crush injury and other penetrating injuries. Tsunami and floods lead to near-drowning and electrocution. Floods cause about 50% of all deaths from natural disasters in the United States.9 The majority of these are due to vehicle-related drowning during flash floods. Flooding also leads to carbon monoxide exposure and death.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common causes of death in a disaster are diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, measles, malaria, and malnutrition.11\n\nDiseases Associated with Natural Disasters\n\nDiseases associated with natural disasters can be divided generally into those associated with overcrowding, waterborne diseases, vectorborne diseases, and other diseases (Table 2). Crowding after disasters has contributed to epidemics of acute respiratory illness and pneumonia, measles, and meningitis. Evacuation to camps following natural disasters is prone to lead to infectious diseases. Camps combine high population density and poor sanitation, synergistic preconditions for fecal-oral and airborne droplet transmission of disease.12\n\nThese illnesses are spread person-to-person by airborne droplet transmission. A measles outbreak followed the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, in 1991. Most of the more than 100,000 displaced persons were members of the Aeta tribe that lived on the slopes of the volcano. More than 18,000 cases of measles were reported within two months of the eruption, with a 25% mortality rate. Since that time, fewer cases of measles have followed natural disasters, as immunization has been more widespread.\n\nAcute respiratory infections (ARI) are a significant contributor to death and disability after disasters, and children less than five are affected disproportionately.4 Respiratory pathogens in post-disaster settings include viral (influenza, RSV, adenoviruses), bacterial (Strep pneumoniae, pertussis, tuberculosis, Legio-nella, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), and diseases transmitted via the respiratory route (measles, varicella, nisseria meningitides). Among reported illnesses after Hurricane Katrina, the proportion of ARI was 12% four days after the levee overflowed and 20% during the next four weeks.9\n\nExposure to open-flame cooking, malnutrition, and lack of access to health care and antibiotics contribute to morbidity and mortality from ARI. ARI was responsible for most of the deaths among survivors of the tsunami in Aceh in 2004.11 The incidence of ARI quadrupled in Nicaragua in the month following Hurricane Mitch in 1998.13 Aspiration pneumonia is seen after flooding and tsunamis and is due to inhalation of soil-contaminated salt water. "Tsunami Lung" is a syndrome of cavitary lung disease and brain abscess seen among Southeast Asia tsunami survivors. It is initiated by the aspiration of soil, sand, and other particulate matter as a consequence of near-drowning. The syndrome is a polymicrobial pneumonia process that occurs up to six weeks later. Identified pathogens include water-borne organisms Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Streptococcal species, Nocardia, Pseudallescheria boydi, and Burkholderia pseudomallei.9,14\n\nFlooding constitutes approximately 40% of natural disasters, and it promotes both waterborne and vectorborne diseases.11 Upper respiratory infections and pneumonias were reported among multiple victims of hurricane Katrina, including a case of pertussis in a two-month-old infant who was rescued from a rooftop in New Orleans and evacuated to Tennessee. Appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis was provided, and no additional cases were reported.7,15\n\nWaterborne diseases include diarrheal pathogens, hepatitis, and leptospirosis. Several pathogens have been associated with diarrhea after disasters. Vibro cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli have been isolated after flooding in West Af-rica. Diarrheal diseases have followed hurricanes and flooding in Bangladesh, Sudan, and Nepal and are the most lethal public health threat to refugees overall.2 Over 70% of deaths among Kurdish refugees in 1991 were due to diarrheal disease. The cholera epidemic that followed the 2010 Haiti earthquake sickened more than 170,000 people and killed more than 3,600.14 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that the form of cholera detected in Haiti is one that is typically found in South Asia and Africa.15 The Haitian outbreak originated from contaminated water near a facility that housed Nepalese troops, who are thought to have introduced the strain to an immunologically naïve local population. From Haiti, several new cases were identified in previously unaffected regions.\n\nThe Dominican Republic detected its first case of cholera in a migrant worker who had returned home from Haiti after the outbreak there. Additional cases of cholera have since been\n\n148 American Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three\n\nreported in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Subsequently, confirmed imported cases have been reported in Florida. The CDC has reported 13 suspected imported cases, with five confirmed as of De-cember 2010. Researchers estimate that an additional 200,000 cases of cholera could arise in the Caribbean within the next 18 months.15\n\nParatyphoid fever, caused by E Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi A, resulted in diarrhea outbreaks in Indonesia in 1992-1993.  Cryptosporidium parvum-related diarrhea followed flooding in Indonesia in 2001-2003.16 An outbreak of diarrheal diseases after flooding in Bangladesh in 2004 involved more than 17,000 cases of V.Cholerae and E.Coli infections.16 All survivors of the December 2004 tsunami in Aceh province in 2004 were forced to drink from unprotected wells, and 85% of these residents who were studied reported diarrhea.11 The risk of diarrheal disease outbreaks following natural disaster is higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries. The association of communicable diseases with malnutrition is well known. In many of these malnourished victims, diseases such as measles, malaria, ARI, and diarrheal diseases are the most common causes of death.\n\nAfter Hurricanes Allison and Katrina, initial reports were that Escherichia coli counts were 100 times higher than those normally found in river runoff. Among the 24,000 Katrina evacuees who were housed in the Reliant Park building in the Hous-ton Astrodome complex, 18% developed acute gastroenteritis from September 2-12, 2005. Approximately 25% of adult and 40% of pediatric medical visits during this time were due to GI illness. Secondary spread to shelter and medical staff also occurred. While 50% of specimens were positive for norovi-rus, no other pathogen was identified.9,17 Clusters of diarrheal disease were reported among persons in evacuation centers in Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas. In Louisi-ana, approximately 20 clusters of diarrheal illness in evacuation centers were reported to and investigated by the CDC. In Memphis, gastrointestinal illness was the most common acute disease complaint among evacuees. Approximately 1,000 cases of diarrhea and vomiting were reported among evacuees in Mississippi and Texas. Norovirus was detected in stool specimens from patients in Texas. Nontyphoidal Salmonella, nontoxigenic V. cholerae O1, and other infections were also identified. No confirmed cases of Shigella dysentery or typhoid fever were reported in evacuees, and by three weeks after the initial relocations following Katrina few additional cases of diarrheal disease were being reported.7,8 Following the 1976 Friuli, Italy, earthquake, there was a five- to sixfold increase in Salmonella secondary to food contamination, poor hygiene, and overcrowding.9\n\nFollowing Hurricane Katrina, an increase in mortality was reported by CDC from Vibrio (Vibrio vulnificus and parahae-molyticus) soft tissue infections. Sixty percent of cases were wound infections and 40% resulted from eating raw shell-f\n\nish. Necrotizing complicated some cases, and overall Vibrio mortality was 40%, and it was 20% in the subset with Vibrio from wounds. Vibrio parahemolyticus cases after Katrina were mostly diarrhea, while V. vulnificus cases were mostly septicemia and wound infection, and very few were diarrhea. For those two species, secondary transmission is not seen. During the flooding following Katrina, Vibrio cases were also reported in Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana. These were mostly in im-muno-compromised, chronically ill people who were exposed seawater. Once contact with brackish seawater ceased, case reports ended and so did any apparent epidemic potential.8,16,17\n\nIn most refugee settings, the case fatality rates (CFR) for cholera are between 2-5%. In the 1994 Rwandan refugees in the Zairian town of Goma (now Republic of the Congo), the rate rose to almost 25%, with almost 90% of adult deaths due to diarrheal illness. This outbreak, which has come to be known as "The Great Lakes Disaster," caused at least 48,000 cases and 23,000 deaths within one month in the refugee camps in Goma, Zaire. Shigella also erupted. Shigella dysenteria type 1, seen in displaced African populations, has a CFR of 10% in young children and in the elderly. Following Hurricane Mitch in 1998, cholera outbreaks occurred in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Belize.4,5,6\n\nThe fecal-oral route (Tables 2 and 3) spreads Hepatitis A, B, and E. Usually infection results from drinking contaminated water, and there is current debate about the role of person-to-person spread. Hepatitis A and B are endemic in most developing countries, so children in these areas develop immunity to it early in life. In hepatitis E-endemic areas, generally mild disease outbreaks have followed flooding. Hepatitis E has only recently been introduced in most parts of Africa, so adults are unlikely to have immunity to it. Thus, any hepatitis-like illness in this region is assumed to be hepatitis E. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable, however, with mortality as high as 25%. Both hepatitis A and hepatitis E were noted in Aceh after the December 2004 tsunami and after the Pakistan earthquake in 2005. An increase in hepatitis A followed the 1983 Popaya, Columbia earthquake.9\n\nLeptospirosis is a bacterial disease that is spread by contact with contaminated water. Rodents shed the organisms in their urine, and contact of the skin and mucous membranes with contaminated water, soil, or vegetation. Several floods in the last decade were followed by leptospirosis outbreaks, notably in Taiwan after Typhoon Nali in 2001, in Mumbai after flooding in 2000, in Portugal in 1967, and Brazil in 1975.4\n\nMeasles incidence and spread transmission after a disaster depends upon the baseline immunization rate of the affected population, especially those under15 years of age. More than 18,000 measles cases occurred after the eruption of Mount Pi-natubo in the Philippines in 1991.18 Increased death rates from measles were reported in camps in Bangladesh (1978), Somalia (1980), Sudan (1985), Ethiopia (1987), Malawi (1988-1990), Mozambique (1988-89, 1991), Philippines (1991), Darfur, Somalia (1994), Haripur, Afghanistan, and Kakuma refugee\n\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three 149\n\ncamps, Kenya (2005). CFR of 2.3% up to 32% were reported.9 Crowded living conditions, as is common among people displaced by natural disasters, contributes to rapid transmission of the organism.12 Also contributing to measles outbreaks is a low baseline vaccination coverage rate among the affected population and, in particular, among children aged <15 years. These conditions that facilitate transmission are also ones that necessitate higher immunization coverage levels to prevent outbreaks. Neisseria meningitidis outbreaks have followed flooding and displacement in Pakistan and Aceh. Meningococcal meningitis outbreaks occurred also in refugees in Thailand in 1979, and among displaced Sudanese in1988, in Khartoum.9,16 Rapid response with antimicrobial prophylaxis interrupts transmission in disaster-affected populations.\n\nImportant vectorborne diseases following disasters include malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, all of which are transmitted by mosquitoes. Disruption of water supplies promoting standing water, especially when associated with large numbers of displaced people sleeping outside, contributes to outbreaks. Months of severe flooding in Bolivia in 2007 triggered a dengue outbreak that killed 35 people. A dramatic rise in malaria cases followed the 1991 earthquake in Costa Rica, associated with changes in habitat that promoted mosquito breeding. Over 75,000 cases of Plasmodium falci-parum malaria were associated with the 1966 Haitian hurricane Flora.17 Malaria-specific mortality is especially severe in situations in which refugees fleeing an area of low endemicity travel through or migrate to an area of high endemicity.2 Outbreaks of louse-borne relapsing fever were seen after refugee concentration in Somalia and Ethiopia.\n\nOther diseases that are seen after disasters are tetanus and coc-cidiomycosis. Spores of C. tetani reside in soil, entering the tissue in contaminated wounds, especially in populations where vaccination levels are low. Once in the wounds, the spores produce a metalloprotease, tetanospasmin, which travels by retrograde movement into the central nervous system. There, the toxin blocks neurotransmission and disinhibits the motor cortex, leading to extensive spasm. Contributing to the occurrence of tetanus after disasters are penetrating injury with spore delivery, co-infection with other bacteria, localized tissue ischemia, and devitalized tissue. An outbreak of tetanus peaked two and one-half weeks after the tsunami in Aceh. The 106 cases that were reported from December 30 - January 26, 2004, occurred in Banda Aceh 4-30 days post-tsunami. CFR for this outbreak was 18.9%.9 The infection is not transmitted person to person. Coccidioides immitis is a fungus that is found in soil in certain semiarid areas. Coccidiomycosis (valley fever) can be associated with exposure to increased levels of airborne dust after landslides and earthquakes. An outbreak occurred after the 1994 earthquake in Southern California. Large dust clouds generated by the earthquake dispersed the spores of Coccidioi-des. The disease incidence peaked two weeks after the earthquake, and there was a ninefold increase in coccidiodomycosis from January-March 1994. Two hundred and three cases were reported in Ventura County, California, including three deaths. There were 30 cases per 100,000 population. Fifty-six percent of the cases and the highest attack rate (114 / 100,000) was in the town of Simi Valley, at the base of a mountain range that had numerous landslides associated with the earthquake. Risk was associated with being within, and amount of time spent in, the dust cloud.\n\nWhile tuberculosis (TB) is not a disease that is associated with natural disasters, it has emerged as a disease among displaced populations. Inadequate access to healthcare among refugees has resulted in an increased spread of TB among them.19 During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991 and during the civil war and famine in Somalia in 1991-92, the incidence of TB increased four-fold.2 In 1985, 26% of deaths among refugees in Somalia were attributable to TB. Co-infection with HIV and malnutrition also contribute to the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of TB in displaced peoples. Control of TB among evacuees has consisted of both detecting new cases and providing treatment continuity for previously known cases.\n\nImmediately after hurricane Katrina, TB program staff sought out known TB patients to check their status and assure that therapy continued. As of September 23, 2004, all 27 currently known TB patients who resided in Alabama, all 21 in Missis-sippi, and 105 (71%) of 147 in Louisiana had been located. Of the 42 TB patients from Louisiana not yet located, 41 were considered noncontagious at the time the hurricane made landfall.19 A homeless person without a previous diagnosis of TB who was evacuated from New Orleans to Philadelphia was identified with symptoms consistent with pulmonary TB. The patient was isolated and begun on treatment for TB disease; a subsequent culture confirmed TB. At least eight other evacuees initially identified as potentially having TB were subsequently determined to have other conditions (e.g., lung cancer and infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria).7,17,19\n\nDiagnosis of Communicable Diseases\n\nThe diagnosis of waterborne, vectorborne, and direct contact diseases is summarized in Table 2. Diagnosis of cholera is made by the direct microscopic observation of the V. cholerae organisms in the stool of victims. Leptospira and hepatitis are detected by specific IgM serologic assays and by detecting anti-HAV or anti-HEV IgM antibodies, respectively. Typhoid is identified by culturing Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, and bowel fluids, and by rapid antibody tests.\n\nThe etiology of ARI is often suggested by the clinical presentation, and culture of respiratory secretions may identify a specific pathogen, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophi-lus influenzae.\n\nMeasles is generally diagnosed by its clinical features, while the etiology of meningitis is made by examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. In the case of vectorborne diseases, parasites are identified on blood smear and serum antibody testing with\n\n150\n\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three\n\nELISA. A rapid dot-blot technique may be used in suspected dengue. Serologic assays are available for detecting IgM specific antibodies in Japanese encephalitis in CSF or blood. Similarly, serological assay is used for detection of yellow fever virus antibodies.\n\nThe Significance of Dead Bodies\n\nThere is a widely held fear that the presence of dead bodies after a disaster contributes to disease transmission. This potential is vastly overstated.4 In reality, when death is directly due to the natural disaster, human remains pose no risk for outbreaks. There are a few specific circumstances in which dead bodies pose any risks, such as deaths from cholera21-24 or hemorrhagic fevers.22 It is recommended that workers who handle bodies employ universal precautions for blood and body fluids and that they use and correctly dispose of gloves. Hand washing with soap after handling bodies and before eating and use of body bags are also important. Except in cases of cholera, shigellosis, or hemorrhagic fever, bodies do not need disinfection before disposal, but disinfection of vehicles and equipment is suggested. In addition, burial, rather than cremation, is recommended, with the bottom of graves above the water table (Table 3).4,20-23\n\nDisease Control after Disasters\n\nAn accurate risk assessment for communicable diseases after a disaster is required in order to identify existing epidemic and endemic diseases that are common in the affected area. Similarly, the living conditions of the affected population are evaluated, with special attention to the availability of safe water and adequate sanitation facilities. Also assessed are the age distribution, nutritional status, and immunization coverage of those affected and their degree of access to healthcare.\n\nPrevention and control of disease begins with hand washing, with proper handling of water and food, and with sewage disposal. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is initiated for diarrheal illness. Where possible, victims and aid workers must avoid entering contaminated water. Preventive Health Measures against the transmission of infectious agents related to natural disasters have been addressed by the WHO.11 WHO recommends: keep hands and vessels clean, avoid preparing food directly in areas surrounded by flood water, separate raw and cooked food, cook food thoroughly, keep food at safe temperatures, use safe water, wear appropriate protective clothing during rescue and cleanup operations, and immunization.\n\nHepatitis and polyvalent Strep pneumonia vaccination may be appropriate. In the event of measles, rapid mass vaccination should be instituted within 72 hours of an initial case report, and vitamin A is administered in children six months to five years of age to prevent complications and to reduce mortality. Rapid mass vaccination is also instituted for meningitis.\n\nMalaria response includes mosquito control, provision of insecticide-treated nets, bedding, and clothing, and the emptying of standing water containers. In the case of dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, mosquito control, isolation of cases, and mass vaccination are implemented.\n\nTable 4: Recommended Handling of Dead Bodies11\n\nSUGGESTED MEASURES FOR HANDLING DEAD BODIES\n\nUniversal precautions for blood and body fluids. Disposal or disinfection of used gloves. Avoiding cross-contamination of personal items. Washing hands after handling bodies and before eating. Disinfection of vehicles and equipment.\n\nUse of body bags, especially for badly damaged bodies. Hepatitis B vaccination.\n\nNo special arrangements, such as disinfection, with disposal of bodies.\n\nNew burial areas sited at least 250 meters away from drinking water sources,and with at least 0.7 meters of distance above the saturated zone.\n\nVIRUS FEATURES DURATION/SYMPTOMS DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT\n\nHepatitis A Most reported vaccine-preventable disease. 33K acute cases. 61K new infections.70% children < 6yrs area symptomatic. Fecal-oral transmission via contaminated food, water,shellfish.\n\nIncubation 28 days average, (range 15-50 days).Viral shedding 2 weeks prior to onset jaundice. Jaundice in 70% of patients, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea, fever.15% with relapsing symptoms 6-9 months.\n\nSerology positive for IgM antibody (anti-IgM HAV) 5-10 days after onset jaundice up to 6 months. IgG antibody (anti-IgG HAV) positive early in course, confers lifetime immunity.Treatment supportive.

Most common in young to middle-aged adults. Fecal-oral transmission via contaminated food, water,shellfish. Increased risk with flooding.\n\nIncubation 40 days average, (range 15-60 days). Jaundice, abdominal pain, fatigue, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting. Secondary symptoms: arthralgias, diarrhea, pruritus, urticaria. Viral shedding for 2 weeks after infection.\n\nSerology positive for IgM antibody (anti-IgM HEV) 5-10 days after onset jaundice up to 6 months. However, not commercially available in US; research lab only. Also PCR, IFA research lab only. IgG treatment supportive. No vaccine available for prevention.\n\nTable 3: Hepatitis A and E17\n\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Medicine® • Fall 2011 • Volume Eight, Number Three 151\n\nMYTH REALITY\n\nForeign medical volunteers with any kind of medical background are needed.\n\n1. The local population almost always covers immediate lifesaving needs.\n\n2. Only skills that are not available in the affected country may be needed.\n\n3. Few survivors owe their lives to outside teams.\n\nAny kind of assistance is needed, and it\'s needed now!\n\n1. A hasty response not based on impartial evaluation only contributes to chaos.\n\n2. Unrequested goods are inappropriate, burdensome, divert scarce resources, and more often burned than separated and inventoried.\n\n3. Not wanted, seldom needed - used clothing, OTC, prescription drugs, or blood products; medical teams or field hospitals.\n\nEpidemics and plagues are inevitable after every disaster.\n\n1. Epidemics rarely ever occur after a disaster.\n\n2. Dead bodies will not lead to catastrophic outbreaks of exotic diseases.\n\n3. Proper resumption of public health services will ensure the public\'s safety (e.g., immunizations, sanitation, waste disposal, water quality, and food safety).\n\nCaveat: Criminal or terror-intent disasters require special considerations.\n\nDisasters bring out the worst in human behavior.\n\n1. While isolated cases of antisocial behavior exist, the majority of people respond spontaneously and generously.\n\nThe community is too shocked and helpless to respond.\n\n1. Many find new strengths.\n\n2. Cross-cultural dedication to common good is most common response to natural disasters.\n\n3. Thousands volunteer to rescue strangers and sift through rubble after earthquakes from Mexico City, California, and Turkey.\n\n4. Most rescue, first aid, and transport are from other casualties and bystanders.\n\nTable 5: Disaster Myths and Realities13\n\nSource: Noji E. Cutler lecture reference.\n\nConclusions\n\nNatural disasters have killed millions of people during the past two decades and have adversely affected the lives of over one billion others. These events include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, floods, and drought. Because of their lack of resources, infrastructure, and emergency medical and disaster systems, developing countries are disproportionately affected by natural disasters.\n\nThe potential for such disasters to be followed by epidemics of communicable diseases is often presumed to be very high, but this has been overstated (Table 5).  In particular, the contribution of dead bodies in epidemic spread after disasters has been vastly exaggerated. In fact, dead bodies are not a significant contributor to disease. Rather, increases in the risk of communicable disease transmission has been demonstrated to be dependent upon: 1) the size, health status, and living conditions of the population displaced by the disaster; 2) crowding; 3) inadequate water and sanitation; and 4) poor access to health services. These factors are also characteristic of sudden population displacement in general.2\n\nAn understanding of epidemics after natural disasters has led to improved detection of, and response to, communicable diseases in these settings. By monitoring the incidence of such diseases and by documenting their impact, it is possible to better quantify the risk of outbreaks following natural disasters. Thus, by preparation for the inevitable, medical, epidemiological, and disaster response personnel will be more able to ameliorate the suffering that will occur after future natural disasters.\n\nDavid Lemonick, MD, is Attending Emergency Physician, Arm-strong County Medical Center, Kittanning, PA, and President-Elect of the American Academy of Emergency Physicians.\n\nPotential Financial Conflicts of Interest: By AJCM® policy, all authors are required to disclose any and all commercial, financial, and other relationships in any way related to the subject of this article that might create any potential conflict of interest.

They include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, floods and drought. Natural disasters can have rapid or slow onset, and serious health, social and economic consequences. During the past two decades, natural disasters have killed millions of people, adversely affecting the lives of at least one billion more people and resulting in substantial economic damage (<i>1</i>). Developing countries are disproportionately affected because of their lack of resources, infrastructure and disaster preparedness systems. </p><p>The potential impact of communicable diseases is often presumed to be very high in the chaos that follows natural disasters. Increases in endemic diseases and the risk of outbreaks, however, are dependent upon many factors that must be systematically evaluated with a comprehensive risk assessment. This allows the prioritization of interventions to reduce the impact of communicable diseases post-disaster. </p><p>The Communicable Diseases Working Group on Emergencies (CD-WGE) at WHO/HQ has developed this document to describe the communicable disease risks in populations affected by natural disasters. It is hoped that this document, by detailing the priority measures that are necessary to reduce the impact of communicable diseases following natural disasters, will help to protect the health of disaster-affected populations. </p><h3><p>1. Assessing the risk of communicable diseases </p></h3><p>1.1 Communicable diseases associated with natural disasters </p><p>The sudden presence of large numbers of dead bodies in disaster-affected areas can heighten expectations of disease outbreaks (<i>2</i>), despite the fact that dead bodies do not pose a risk of outbreaks following natural disasters (<i>3</i>). Rather, the risk of outbreaks is associated with the size, health status and living conditions of the population displaced by the natural disaster. Crowding, inadequate water and sanitation, and poor access to health services, often characteristic of sudden population displacement, increase the risk of communicable disease transmission (<i>4</i>). </p><p>Although the overall risk of communicable disease outbreaks is lower than often perceived, the risk of transmission of certain endemic and epidemic-prone diseases can increase following natural disasters. </p><p>1.2 Waterborne diseases<b> </b></p><p><b>Diarrhoeal disease</b> outbreaks can occur following contamination of drinking-water, and have been reported following flooding and related displacement. An outbreak of diarrhoeal disease post flooding in Bangladesh in 2004 involved more than 17 000 cases, with the isolation of <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> (O1 Ogawa and O1 Inaba) and enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>5</i>). A large (>16 000 cases) cholera epidemic (O1 Ogawa) in West Bengal in 1998 was attributed to preceding floods (<i>6</i>), and floods in Mozambique in January-March 2000 led to an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea (<i>7</i>). </p><p>The risk of diarrhoeal disease outbreaks following natural disasters is higher in developing than in developed countries (<i>8</i>). In Aceh Province, Indonesia, a rapid health assessment performed in the town of Calang two weeks after the December 2004 tsunami found that 100% of the survivors drank from unprotected wells, and that 85% of residents reported diarrhoea in the previous two weeks (<i>9</i>). In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, following the 2005 earthquake, an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea occurred in an unplanned, poorly-equipped camp of 1800 persons. The outbreak involved over 750 cases, mostly adults, and was controlled following the provision of adequate water and sanitation facilities (<i>10</i>). In the United States, diarrhoeal illness was noted following hurricanes Allison (<i>11</i>) and Katrina (<i>12-14</i>), and norovirus, <i>Salmonella</i>, and toxigenic and non-toxigenic <i>V. cholerae</i> were confirmed among Katrina evacuees. </p><p><b>Hepatitis A and E </b>are also transmitted by the faecal-oral route, in association with lack of access to safe water and sanitation. Hepatitis A is endemic in most developing countries, and children are exposed and develop immunity at an early age. As a result, the risk of large outbreaks is usually low in these settings. In endemic areas, hepatitis E outbreaks frequently follow heavy rains and floods; it is generally a mild, self-limited illness, but in pregnant women case-fatality rates can be up to 25% (<i>15</i>). Clusters of both hepatitis A and hepatitis E were noted in Aceh following the December 2004 tsunami (<i>16</i>). </p><p><b>Leptospirosis </b>is<b> </b>a zoonotic bacterial disease that is transmitted through contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water, damp vegetation, or mud contaminated with rodent urine. Infected rodents shed large amounts of leptospires in their urine. Flooding facilitates the spread of the organism due to the proliferation of rodents and the proximity of rodents to humans on shared high ground. Outbreaks of leptospirosis occurred in Taiwan, China, associated with Typhoon Nali in 2001 (<i>17</i>), and following flooding in Mumbai, India, in 2000 (<i>18</i>). </p><p>1.3 Diseases associated with crowding </p><p><b>Measles</b> and the risk of transmission in the disaster-affected population is dependent on the baseline vaccination coverage rates among the affected population, and in particular among children aged &lt;15 years. Crowded living conditions, as is common among people displaced by natural disasters, facilitate transmission and necessitate even higher immunization coverage levels to prevent outbreaks (<i>19</i>). A measles outbreak in the Philippines in 1991 among people displaced by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo involved more than 18 000 cases (<i>20</i>). In Aceh following the tsunami, a cluster of measles involving 35 cases occurred in Aceh Utara district, and continuing sporadic cases were common despite mass vaccination campaigns (<i>16</i>). Sporadic cases and clusters of measles (>400 clinical cases in the six months following the earthquake) also occurred in Pakistan following the 2005 South Asia earthquake (<i>21</i>). <b> </b></p><p><b>Meningitis </b>caused by<i> Neisseria meningitidis</i><b> </b>is transmitted from person to person, particularly in situations of crowding. Cases and deaths from meningitis among those displaced in Aceh and Pakistan have been documented (<i>16, 21</i>). Prompt response with antibiotic prophylaxis, as occurred in Aceh and Pakistan, can interrupt transmission. </p><p><b>Acute respiratory infections</b> <b>(ARI) </b>are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among displaced populations, particularly in children aged &lt;5 years. Lack of access to health services and to antibiotics for treatment further increases the risk of death from ARI. Risk factors among displaced persons include crowding, exposure to indoor cooking and poor nutrition. The reported incidence of ARI increased four-fold in Nicaragua in the 30 days following Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (<i>22</i>), and ARI accounted for the highest number of cases and deaths among those displaced by the tsunami in Aceh in 2004 (<i>16</i>) and by the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan (<i>21</i>).<b> </b></p><p>1.4 Vector-borne diseases </p><p>Natural disasters, particularly meteorological events such as cyclones, hurricanes and flooding, can affect vector breeding sites and vector-borne disease transmission. While initial flooding may wash away existing mosquito breeding sites, standing-water caused by heavy rainfall or overflow of rivers can create new breeding sites. This can result (with typically some weeks delay) in an increase of the vector population and potential for disease transmission, depending on the local mosquito vector species and its preferred habitat. The crowding of infected and susceptible hosts, a weakened public health infrastructure and interruptions of ongoing control programmes are all risk factors for vector-borne disease transmission (<i>23</i>). </p><p><b>Malaria</b> outbreaks in the wake of flooding are a well-known phenomena. An earthquake in Costa Rica\'s Atlantic Region in 1991 was associated with changes in habitat that were beneficial for breeding and preceded an extreme rise in malaria cases (<i>24</i>). Additionally, periodic flooding linked to El Nino-Southern Oscillation has been associated with malaria epidemics in the dry coastal region of northern Peru (<i>25</i>). </p><p><b>Dengue</b> transmission is influenced by meteorological conditions including rainfall and humidity and often exhibits strong seasonality. However, transmission is not directly associated with flooding. Such events may coincide with periods of high transmission risk and be exacerbated by increased availability of vector breeding sites - mostly artificial containers - caused by disruption of basic water supply and solid waste disposal services. </p><p>The risk of vector-borne disease outbreaks can be influenced by other complicating factors, such as changes in human behaviour (increased exposure to mosquitoes while sleeping outside, movement from non-endemic to endemic areas, a pause in disease control activities, overcrowding), or changes in the habitat which promote mosquito breeding (landslide deforestation, river damming and re-routing). </p><p>1.5 Other diseases associated with natural disasters </p><p><b>Tetanus</b> is not transmitted from person to person, but is caused by a toxin released by the anaerobic tetanus bacillus <i>Clostridium tetani</i>. Contaminated wounds, particularly in populations where routine vaccination coverage levels are low, are associated with morbidity and mortality from tetanus. A cluster of 106 cases of tetanus, including 20 deaths, occurred in Aceh and peaked 2½ weeks following the tsunami (<i>26</i>). Cases were also reported in Pakistan following the 2005 earthquake (<i>21</i>). </p><p>An unusual outbreak of <b>coccidiomycosis</b> occurred following the January 1994 southern California earthquake. The infection is not transmitted from person to person, but is caused by the fungus <i>Coccidioides immitis, </i>which is found in soil in certain semi-arid areas of North and South America. This outbreak was associated with exposure to increased levels of airborne dust subsequent to landslides in the aftermath of the earthquake (<i>27</i>). </p><p>1.6 Disaster-related disruptions </p><p>Power cuts related to disasters may disrupt water treatment and supply plants, thereby increasing the risk of water-borne diseases. Lack of power may also affect proper functioning of health facilities, including preservation of the cold chain. An increase in diarrhoeal incidence in New York City followed a massive power outage in the United States in 2003. Investigation of the outbreak revealed an association with the consumption of meat and seafood after the onset of the power outage, when refrigeration facilities were widely interrupted (<i>28</i>). </p><h3><p>2. Dead bodies and the risk of communicable diseases </p></h3><p><b>Deaths </b>associated with natural disasters are overwhelmingly caused by<b> </b>blunt trauma, crush-related injuries or drowning. The sudden presence of large numbers of dead bodies in the disaster-affected area can fuel fears of outbreaks (<i>2</i>). There is <b>no evidence that dead bodies pose a risk of epidemics</b> following natural disasters (<i>3</i>). <b> </b></p><p>When death is directly due to the natural disaster, human remains do not pose a risk for outbreaks; the source of infection is more likely to be the survivors than those killed by the natural disaster (<i>29</i>). Even when death is directly due to communicable diseases, pathogenic organisms do not survive long in the human body following death (<i>30</i>). Dead bodies pose health risks only in a few situations requiring specific precautions, such as deaths from cholera (<i>31</i>) or haemorrhagic fevers (<i>32</i>). </p><p><b>Management of dead bodies</b><i> (3)</i></p><h4><p> </p><p>The mass management of dead bodies is often based on the false belief that they represent an epidemic hazard if not buried or burned immediately. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Burial is preferable to cremation in mass casualty situations. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Every effort should be made to identify the bodies. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Mass burial should be avoided if at all possible. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Families should have the opportunity, and access to materials, to conduct culturally appropriate funerals and burials according to social custom. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Where existing facilities such as graveyards or crematoria are inadequate, alternative locations or facilities should be provided. </p></h4><p><b>For workers routinely handling dead bodies </b></p><p>• </p><h4><p>Ensure universal precautions for blood and body fluids </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Ensure use and correct disposal of gloves </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Use body bags if available </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Wash hands with soap after handling dead bodies and before eating </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Disinfect vehicles and equipment </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Dead bodies do not need disinfection before disposal (except in case of cholera, shigellosis, or haemorrhagic fever) </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>The bottom of any grave must be at least 1.5 m above the water table, with a 0.7 m unsaturated zone. </p></h4><h3><p>3. Prevention of communicable diseases following natural disasters </p></h3><p>The following priority measures are critical to reduce the impact of communicable diseases after natural disasters: </p><p>3.1 Safe water, sanitation, site planning </p><p>Ensuring uninterrupted provision of safe drinking-water is the most important preventive measure to be implemented following a natural disaster. Chlorine is widely available, inexpensive, easily used and effective against nearly all waterborne pathogens. </p><p>Settlement planning must provide for adequate access for water and sanitation needs and meet the minimum space requirements per person, in accordance with international guidelines (<i>33</i>). </p><p>3.2 Primary health-care services </p><p>Access to primary care is critical to prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of diseases, as well as providing an entry point for secondary and tertiary care. The immediate impact of communicable diseases can be mitigated with the following interventions: </p><p>• Ensure early diagnosis and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases and ARI, particularly in those aged &lt;5 years. </p><p>• Ensure early diagnosis and treatment for malaria in endemic areas (within 24 hours of onset of fever, using artemisinin-based combination therapy ACT for <i>falciparum</i> malaria). </p><p>• Ensure the availability and application of treatment protocols for the main communicable disease threats.<b> </b> </p><p>• Ensure proper wound cleaning and care. <b>Tetanus</b> toxoid with or without tetanus immunoglobulin, as appropriate, should accompany wound treatment post-disaster. </p><p>• Ensure availability of drugs included in the interagency emergency health kit, e.g. oral rehydration salts for management of diarrhoeal diseases, antibiotics for ARI. </p><p>• Distribute health education messages, including: </p><p>• </p><h4><p>encouraging good hygienic practices; </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>promoting safe food preparation techniques; </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>ensuring boiling or chlorination of water; </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>encouraging early treatment seeking behavior in case of fever; </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>encouraging use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets as a personal protection measure in malaria-endemic areas. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>Vector control interventions adapted to the local context and disease epidemiology</p></h4><p><b> </b> </p><p>3.3 Surveillance/early warning system </p><p>Rapid detection of cases of epidemic-prone diseases is essential to ensure rapid control. A surveillance/early warning system should be quickly established to detect outbreaks and monitor priority endemic diseases. </p><p>• Priority diseases to be included in the surveillance system should be based on a systematic communicable disease risk assessment. In some situations, the threats may include rare diseases such as viral haemorrhagic fevers, plague or tularaemia. A comprehensive communicable disease risk assessment by WHO can identify and prioritize these threats. </p><p>• Ensure health-care workers are trained to detect priority diseases and that prompt reporting to lead health agency occurs. </p><p>• Ensure sampling and transport materials for investigation, and appropriate stockpiles are readily available for rapid response to outbreaks, e.g. cholera kits, in areas where cholera is considered a risk. </p><p>3.4 Immunization </p><p>• <b>Mass measles immunization</b> together with vitamin A supplementation are immediate health priorities following natural disasters in areas with inadequate coverage levels. Where baseline coverage rates among those aged &lt;15 years are below 90%, mass measles immunization should be implemented as soon as possible. The priority age groups are 6 months to 5 years, and up to 15 years if resources allow. <b> </b></p><p>• Current <b>typhoid </b>vaccines are not recommended for mass immunization campaigns to prevent typhoid disease. Typhoid vaccination in conjunction with other preventive measures may be useful to control typhoid outbreaks, depending on local circumstances.<b> </b></p><p>• <b>Hepatitis A </b>vaccine is generally not recommended to prevent outbreaks in the disaster area.<b> </b></p><p>• The cost of the <b>cholera</b> vaccine, and the logistic difficulties involved with the administration, have prohibited its widespread use. Although helpful in specific circumstances, it should not be viewed as a replacement for the provision of adequate water and sanitation. The usefulness of the cholera vaccine, relative to other public health priorities, has not been evaluated in disaster-affected areas. </p><p>3.5 Prevention of malaria and dengue </p><p>• </p><h4><p>Specific preventive interventions for malaria must be based on an informed assessment of the local situation, including on the prevalent parasite species and the main vectors. </p></h4><p>• An increase in mosquito numbers may be delayed following flooding, allowing time for implementation of preventive measures such as indoor residual spraying of insecticides, or the re-treatment/distribution of insecticide-treated nets preferably long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) in areas where their use is well-known and accepted. </p><p>• Early detection of a possible malaria outbreak can be enhanced by monitoring weekly case numbers must be part of the surveillance/early warning system. Periodic laboratory confirmation of rapid test-positive fever cases is recommended to track the slide/test positivity rate. </p><p>• </p><h4><p>Treatment with artemisinin-based combination (ACT) therapy should be provided free of charge to the user in disaster-affected areas with falciparum malaria. An active search for fever cases may be necessary to reduce mortality. </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>For dengue, the main preventive efforts should be directed towards vector control. Social mobilization and health education of the community should emphasize elimination of vector breeding sites as much as possible, specifically by: </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>continuous covering of all stored water containers; </p></h4><p>• </p><h4><p>removal or destruction of solid debris where water can collect (bottles, tyres, tins, etc.). </p></h4><h3><p>4. Disaster preparedness plans and control of communicable diseases </p></h3><p>Although disaster-related deaths are overwhelmingly caused by the initial traumatic impact of the event, disaster preparedness plans should consider the health needs of the surviving disaster-affected populations. The health impacts associated with the sudden crowding together of large numbers of survivors, often with inadequate access to safe water and sanitation facilities, will require planning for both therapeutic and preventive interventions, such as rehydration materials, antibiotics and measles vaccination materials. Disaster response teams should be aware of and have access to the latest updated guidelines for communicable disease prevention and control, such as the WHO field manual on <i>Communicable disease control in emergencies </i>(<i>34</i>) and the Sphere project\'s <i>Humanitarian charter and minimum standards in disaster response</i> (<i>33</i>). </p><p>The risk of outbreaks following natural disasters, though often incorrectly connected to the presence of dead bodies, is closely related to the size, health status and living conditions of the displaced population. The risk of transmission of endemic communicable diseases, such as ARI and diarrhoeal diseases, is increased in displaced populations due to associated crowding, inadequate water and sanitation and poor access to health care. Improved detection and response to communicable diseases is important in order to monitor the incidence of diseases, to document their impact and to help to better quantify the risk of outbreaks following natural disasters. </p><h3><p>References </p></h3><p>1. <i>About natural disasters</i>.

CD-WGE provides technical and operational support on communicable disease control to WHO regional and country offices, ministries of health, other United Nations agencies, and nongovernmental and international organizations. The working group includes the departments of Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR), Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD), Global Malaria Programme (GMP), Stop TB (STB), HIV/AIDS (HIV), Child and Adolescent Health and Development (CAH), Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals (IVB), Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments (SDE) and Health Action in Crises (HAC).\n\nIntroduction\n\nNatural disasters are catastrophic events with atmospheric, geologic and hydrologic origins. They include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tsunamis, floods and drought. Natural disasters can have rapid or slow onset, and serious health, social and economic consequences. During the past two decades, natural disasters have killed millions of people, adversely affecting the lives of at least one billion more people and resulting in substantial economic damage (1). Developing countries are disproportionately affected because of their lack of resources, infrastructure and disaster preparedness systems.\n\nThe potential impact of communicable diseases is often presumed to be very high in the chaos that follows natural disasters. Increases in endemic diseases and the risk of outbreaks, however, are dependent upon many factors that must be systematically evaluated with a comprehensive risk assessment. This allows the prioritization of interventions to reduce the impact of communicable diseases post-disaster.\n\nThe Communicable Diseases Working Group on Emergencies (CD-WGE) at WHO/HQ has developed this document to describe the communicable disease risks in populations affected by natural disasters. It is hoped that this document, by detailing the priority measures that are necessary to reduce the impact of communicable diseases following natural disasters, will help to protect the health of disaster-affected populations.\n\n1. Assessing the risk of communicable diseases\n\n1.1 Communicable diseases associated with natural disasters\n\nThe sudden presence of large numbers of dead bodies in disaster-affected areas can heighten expectations of disease outbreaks (2), despite the fact that dead bodies do not pose a risk of outbreaks following natural disasters (3). Rather, the risk of outbreaks is associated with the size, health status and living conditions of the population displaced by the natural disaster. Crowding, inadequate water and sanitation, and poor access to health services, often characteristic of sudden population displacement, increase the risk of communicable disease transmission (4).\n\nAlthough the overall risk of communicable disease outbreaks is lower than often perceived, the risk of transmission of certain endemic and epidemic-prone diseases can increase following natural disasters.\n\n1.2 Waterborne diseases\n\nDiarrhoeal disease outbreaks can occur following contamination of drinking-water, and have been reported following flooding and related displacement. An outbreak of diarrhoeal disease post flooding in Bangladesh in 2004 involved more than 17 000 cases, with the isolation of Vibrio cholerae (O1 Ogawa and O1 Inaba) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (5). A large (>16 000 cases) cholera epidemic (O1 Ogawa) in West Bengal in 1998 was attributed to preceding floods (6), and floods in Mozambique in January-March 2000 led to an increase in the incidence of diarrhoea (7).\n\nThe risk of diarrhoeal disease outbreaks following natural disasters is higher in developing than in developed countries (8). In Aceh Province, Indonesia, a rapid health assessment performed in the town of Calang two weeks after the December 2004 tsunami found that 100% of the survivors drank from unprotected wells, and that 85% of residents reported diarrhoea in the previous two weeks (9). In Muzaffarabad, Pakistan, following the 2005 earthquake, an outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea occurred in an unplanned, poorly-equipped camp of 1800 persons. The outbreak involved over 750 cases, mostly adults, and was controlled following the provision of adequate water and sanitation facilities (10). In the United States, diarrhoeal illness was noted following hurricanes Allison (11) and Katrina (12-14), and norovirus, Salmonella, and toxigenic and non-toxigenic V. cholerae were confirmed among Katrina evacuees.\n\nHepatitis A and E are also transmitted by the faecal-oral route, in association with lack of access to safe water and sanitation. Hepatitis A is endemic in most developing countries, and children are exposed and develop immunity at an early age. As a result, the risk of large outbreaks is usually low in these settings. In endemic areas, hepatitis E outbreaks frequently follow heavy rains and floods; it is generally a mild, self-limited illness, but in pregnant women case-fatality rates can be up to 25% (15). Clusters of both hepatitis A and hepatitis E were noted in Aceh following the December 2004 tsunami (16).\n\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease that is transmitted through contact of the skin and mucous membranes with water, damp vegetation, or mud contaminated with rodent urine. Infected rodents shed large amounts of leptospires in their urine. Flooding facilitates the spread of the organism due to the proliferation of rodents and the proximity of rodents to humans on shared high ground. Outbreaks of leptospirosis occurred in Taiwan, China, associated with Typhoon Nali in 2001 (17), and following flooding in Mumbai, India, in 2000 (18).\n\n1.3 Diseases associated with crowding\n\nMeasles and the risk of transmission in the disaster-affected population is dependent on the baseline vaccination coverage rates among the affected population, and in particular among children aged <15 years. Crowded living conditions, as is common among people displaced by natural disasters, facilitate transmission and necessitate even higher immunization coverage levels to prevent outbreaks (19). A measles outbreak in the Philippines in 1991 among people displaced by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo involved more than 18 000 cases (20). In Aceh following the tsunami, a cluster of measles involving 35 cases occurred in Aceh Utara district, and continuing sporadic cases were common despite mass vaccination campaigns (16). Sporadic cases and clusters of measles (>400 clinical cases in the six months following the earthquake) also occurred in Pakistan following the 2005 South Asia earthquake (21).\n\nMeningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis is transmitted from person to person, particularly in situations of crowding. Cases and deaths from meningitis among those displaced in Aceh and Pakistan have been documented (16, 21). Prompt response with antibiotic prophylaxis, as occurred in Aceh and Pakistan, can interrupt transmission.\n\nAcute respiratory infections (ARI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among displaced populations, particularly in children aged <5 years. Lack of access to health services and to antibiotics for treatment further increases the risk of death from ARI. Risk factors among displaced persons include crowding, exposure to indoor cooking and poor nutrition. The reported incidence of ARI increased four-fold in Nicaragua in the 30 days following Hurricane Mitch in 1998 (22), and ARI accounted for the highest number of cases and deaths among those displaced by the tsunami in Aceh in 2004 (16) and by the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan (21).\n\n1.4 Vector-borne diseases\n\nNatural disasters, particularly meteorological events such as cyclones, hurricanes and flooding, can affect vector breeding sites and vector-borne disease transmission. While initial flooding may wash away existing mosquito breeding sites, standing-water caused by heavy rainfall or overflow of rivers can create new breeding sites. This can result (with typically some weeks delay) in an increase of the vector population and potential for disease transmission, depending on the local mosquito vector species and its preferred habitat. The crowding of infected and susceptible hosts, a weakened public health infrastructure and interruptions of ongoing control programmes are all risk factors for vector-borne disease transmission (23).\n\nMalaria outbreaks in the wake of flooding are a well-known phenomena. An earthquake in Costa Rica\'s Atlantic Region in 1991 was associated with changes in habitat that were beneficial for breeding and preceded an extreme rise in malaria cases (24). Additionally, periodic flooding linked to El Nino-Southern Oscillation has been associated with malaria epidemics in the dry coastal region of northern Peru (25).\n\nDengue transmission is influenced by meteorological conditions including rainfall and humidity and often exhibits strong seasonality. However, transmission is not directly associated with flooding. Such events may coincide with periods of high transmission risk and be exacerbated by increased availability of vector breeding sites - mostly artificial containers - caused by disruption of basic water supply and solid waste disposal services.\n\nThe risk of vector-borne disease outbreaks can be influenced by other complicating factors, such as changes in human behaviour (increased exposure to mosquitoes while sleeping outside, movement from non-endemic to endemic areas, a pause in disease control activities, overcrowding), or changes in the habitat which promote mosquito breeding (landslide deforestation, river damming and re-routing).\n\n1.5 Other diseases associated with natural disasters\n\nTetanus is not transmitted from person to person, but is caused by a toxin released by the anaerobic tetanus bacillus Clostridium tetani. Contaminated wounds, particularly in populations where routine vaccination coverage levels are low, are associated with morbidity and mortality from tetanus. A cluster of 106 cases of tetanus, including 20 deaths, occurred in Aceh and peaked 2½ weeks following the tsunami (26). Cases were also reported in Pakistan following the 2005 earthquake (21).\n\nAn unusual outbreak of coccidiomycosis occurred following the January 1994 southern California earthquake. The infection is not transmitted from person to person, but is caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis, which is found in soil in certain semi-arid areas of North and South America. This outbreak was associated with exposure to increased levels of airborne dust subsequent to landslides in the aftermath of the earthquake (27).\n\n1.6 Disaster-related disruptions\n\nPower cuts related to disasters may disrupt water treatment and supply plants, thereby increasing the risk of water-borne diseases. Lack of power may also affect proper functioning of health facilities, including preservation of the cold chain. An increase in diarrhoeal incidence in New York City followed a massive power outage in the United States in 2003. Investigation of the outbreak revealed an association with the consumption of meat and seafood after the onset of the power outage, when refrigeration facilities were widely interrupted (28).\n\n2. Dead bodies and the risk of communicable diseases\n\nDeaths associated with natural disasters are overwhelmingly caused by blunt trauma, crush-related injuries or drowning. The sudden presence of large numbers of dead bodies in the disaster-affected area can fuel fears of outbreaks (2). There is no evidence that dead bodies pose a risk of epidemics following natural disasters (3).\n\nWhen death is directly due to the natural disaster, human remains do not pose a risk for outbreaks; the source of infection is more likely to be the survivors than those killed by the natural disaster (29). Even when death is directly due to communicable diseases, pathogenic organisms do not survive long in the human body following death (30). Dead bodies pose health risks only in a few situations requiring specific precautions, such as deaths from cholera (31) or haemorrhagic fevers (32).\n\nManagement of dead bodies (3)\n\nThe mass management of dead bodies is often based on the false belief that they represent an epidemic hazard if not buried or burned immediately.\n\n•\n\nBurial is preferable to cremation in mass casualty situations.\n\n•\n\nEvery effort should be made to identify the bodies.\n\n•\n\nMass burial should be avoided if at all possible.\n\n•\n\nFamilies should have the opportunity, and access to materials, to conduct culturally appropriate funerals and burials according to social custom.\n\n•\n\nWhere existing facilities such as graveyards or crematoria are inadequate, alternative locations or facilities should be provided.\n\nFor workers routinely handling dead bodies\n\n•\n\nEnsure universal precautions for blood and body fluids\n\n•\n\nEnsure use and correct disposal of gloves\n\n•\n\nUse body bags if available\n\n•\n\nWash hands with soap after handling dead bodies and before eating\n\n•\n\nDisinfect vehicles and equipment\n\n•\n\nDead bodies do not need disinfection before disposal (except in case of cholera, shigellosis, or haemorrhagic fever)\n\n•\n\nThe bottom of any grave must be at least 1.5 m above the water table, with a 0.7 m unsaturated zone.\n\n3. Prevention of communicable diseases following natural disasters\n\nThe following priority measures are critical to reduce the impact of communicable diseases after natural disasters:\n\n3.1 Safe water, sanitation, site planning\n\nEnsuring uninterrupted provision of safe drinking-water is the most important preventive measure to be implemented following a natural disaster. Chlorine is widely available, inexpensive, easily used and effective against nearly all waterborne pathogens.\n\nSettlement planning must provide for adequate access for water and sanitation needs and meet the minimum space requirements per person, in accordance with international guidelines (33).\n\n3.2 Primary health-care services\n\nAccess to primary care is critical to prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of diseases, as well as providing an entry point for secondary and tertiary care. The immediate impact of communicable diseases can be mitigated with the following interventions:\n\n• Ensure early diagnosis and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases and ARI, particularly in those aged <5 years.\n\n• Ensure early diagnosis and treatment for malaria in endemic areas (within 24 hours of onset of fever, using artemisinin-based combination therapy ACT for falciparum malaria).\n\n• Ensure the availability and application of treatment protocols for the main communicable disease threats.\n\n• Ensure proper wound cleaning and care. Tetanus toxoid with or without tetanus immunoglobulin, as appropriate, should accompany wound treatment post-disaster.\n\n• Ensure availability of drugs included in the interagency emergency health kit, e.g. oral rehydration salts for management of diarrhoeal diseases, antibiotics for ARI.\n\n• Distribute health education messages, including:\n\n•\n\nencouraging good hygienic practices;\n\n•\n\npromoting safe food preparation techniques;\n\n•\n\nensuring boiling or chlorination of water;\n\n•\n\nencouraging early treatment seeking behavior in case of fever;\n\n•\n\nencouraging use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets as a personal protection measure in malaria-endemic areas.\n\n•\n\nVector control interventions adapted to the local context and disease epidemiology\n\n3.3 Surveillance/early warning system\n\nRapid detection of cases of epidemic-prone diseases is essential to ensure rapid control. A surveillance/early warning system should be quickly established to detect outbreaks and monitor priority endemic diseases.\n\n• Priority diseases to be included in the surveillance system should be based on a systematic communicable disease risk assessment. In some situations, the threats may include rare diseases such as viral haemorrhagic fevers, plague or tularaemia. A comprehensive communicable disease risk assessment by WHO can identify and prioritize these threats.\n\n• Ensure health-care workers are trained to detect priority diseases and that prompt reporting to lead health agency occurs.\n\n• Ensure sampling and transport materials for investigation, and appropriate stockpiles are readily available for rapid response to outbreaks, e.g. cholera kits, in areas where cholera is considered a risk.\n\n3.4 Immunization\n\n• Mass measles immunization together with vitamin A supplementation are immediate health priorities following natural disasters in areas with inadequate coverage levels. Where baseline coverage rates among those aged <15 years are below 90%, mass measles immunization should be implemented as soon as possible. The priority age groups are 6 months to 5 years, and up to 15 years if resources allow.\n\n• Current typhoid vaccines are not recommended for mass immunization campaigns to prevent typhoid disease. Typhoid vaccination in conjunction with other preventive measures may be useful to control typhoid outbreaks, depending on local circumstances.\n\n• Hepatitis A vaccine is generally not recommended to prevent outbreaks in the disaster area.\n\n• The cost of the cholera vaccine, and the logistic difficulties involved with the administration, have prohibited its widespread use. Although helpful in specific circumstances, it should not be viewed as a replacement for the provision of adequate water and sanitation. The usefulness of the cholera vaccine, relative to other public health priorities, has not been evaluated in disaster-affected areas.\n\n3.5 Prevention of malaria and dengue\n\n•\n\nSpecific preventive interventions for malaria must be based on an informed assessment of the local situation, including on the prevalent parasite species and the main vectors.\n\n• An increase in mosquito numbers may be delayed following flooding, allowing time for implementation of preventive measures such as indoor residual spraying of insecticides, or the re-treatment/distribution of insecticide-treated nets preferably long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) in areas where their use is well-known and accepted.\n\n• Early detection of a possible malaria outbreak can be enhanced by monitoring weekly case numbers must be part of the surveillance/early warning system. Periodic laboratory confirmation of rapid test-positive fever cases is recommended to track the slide/test positivity rate.\n\n•\n\nTreatment with artemisinin-based combination (ACT) therapy should be provided free of charge to the user in disaster-affected areas with falciparum malaria. An active search for fever cases may be necessary to reduce mortality.\n\n•\n\nFor dengue, the main preventive efforts should be directed towards vector control. Social mobilization and health education of the community should emphasize elimination of vector breeding sites as much as possible, specifically by:\n\n•\n\ncontinuous covering of all stored water containers;\n\n•\n\nremoval or destruction of solid debris where water can collect (bottles, tyres, tins, etc.).\n\n4. Disaster preparedness plans and control of communicable diseases\n\nAlthough disaster-related deaths are overwhelmingly caused by the initial traumatic impact of the event, disaster preparedness plans should consider the health needs of the surviving disaster-affected populations. The health impacts associated with the sudden crowding together of large numbers of survivors, often with inadequate access to safe water and sanitation facilities, will require planning for both therapeutic and preventive interventions, such as rehydration materials, antibiotics and measles vaccination materials. Disaster response teams should be aware of and have access to the latest updated guidelines for communicable disease prevention and control, such as the WHO field manual on Communicable disease control in emergencies (34) and the Sphere project\'s Humanitarian charter and minimum standards in disaster response (33).\n\nThe risk of outbreaks following natural disasters, though often incorrectly connected to the presence of dead bodies, is closely related to the size, health status and living conditions of the displaced population. The risk of transmission of endemic communicable diseases, such as ARI and diarrhoeal diseases, is increased in displaced populations due to associated crowding, inadequate water and sanitation and poor access to health care. Improved detection and response to communicable diseases is important in order to monitor the incidence of diseases, to document their impact and to help to better quantify the risk of outbreaks following natural disasters.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Repair defective electrical wiring and leaky gas connections. These are potential fire risks. Secure water heaters, LPG cylinders etc., by strapping them to the walls or bolting to the floor. Store weed killers, pesticides, and flammable products securely in closed cabinets with latches and on bottom shelves. Identify safe places indoors and outdoors. Under strong dining table, bed Against an inside wall Away from where glass could shatter around windows, mirrors, pictures, or where heavy bookcases or other heavy furniture could fall over In the open, away from buildings, trees, telephone and electrical lines, flyovers and bridges Know emergency telephone numbers (such as those of doctors, hospitals, the police, etc) Educate yourself and family members   Matrix of IEC material for earthquake Safety and Preparedness Awareness Generation Resources for Earthquake Diasaster Management Disaster(Earthquake) Resistant Construction Practice Techno Legal Regime for Safe Construction Practice (Model Amendment in Town & Country Planning Legislations, Regulation for Land Use Zoning and Building Byelaws for Structural Safety) Past Programmes/Projects, Resource Materials on Earthquake Risk Management. Have a disaster emergency kit ready Battery operated torch with extra batteries Battery operated radio First aid kit and manual Emergency food (dry items) and water (packed and sealed) Candles and matches in a waterproof container Knife Chlorine tablets or powdered water purifiers Can opener. Essential medicines Cash and credit cards Thick ropes and cords Sturdy shoes Develop an emergency communication plan In case family members are separated from one another during an earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster. Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the \'family contact\' after the disaster; it is often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person. Help your community get ready Publish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on earthquakes. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices and hospitals. Conduct week-long series on locating hazards in the home. Work with local emergency services and officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairment on what to do during an earthquake. Provide tips on conducting earthquake drills in the home. Interview representatives of the gas, electric, and water companies about shutting off utilities. Work together in your community to apply your knowledge to building codes, retrofitting programmes, hazard hunts, and neighborhood and family emergency plans. What to Do During an Earthquake Stay as safe as possible during an earthquake. Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks and a larger earthquake might occur. Minimize your movements to a few steps that reach a nearby safe place and stay indoors until the shaking has stopped and you are sure exiting is safe. If indoors DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there is no a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building. Protect yourself by staying under the lintel of an inner door, in the corner of a room, under a table or even under a bed. Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, (such as lighting fixtures or furniture). Stay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place. Use a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load bearing doorway. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave. Be aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on. If outdoors Do not move from where you are. However, move away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires. If you are in open space, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings; at exits; and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects. If in a moving vehicle Stop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires. Proceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake. If trapped under debris Do not light a match. Do not move about or kick up dust. Cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust.

Cyclones Information Zone Map Do\'s and Dont\'s Recover and Build Emergency Kit Guidelines Projects and Schemes Do\'s & Dont\'s Before the Cyclone season: Check the house; secure loose tiles and carry out repairs of doors and windows Remove dead branches or dying trees close to the house; anchor removable objects such as lumber piles, loose tin sheets, loose bricks, garbage cans, sign-boards etc. which can fly in strong winds Keep some wooden boards ready so that glass windows can be boarded if needed Keep a hurricane lantern filled with kerosene, battery operated torches and enough dry cells Demolish condemned buildings Keep some extra batteries for transistors Keep some dry non-perishable food always ready for use in emergency Necessary actions The actions that need to be taken in the event of a cyclone threat can broadly be divided into : Immediately before the cyclone season When cyclone alerts and warnings are communicated When evacuations are advised When the cyclone has crossed the coast   When the Cyclone starts Listen to the radio (All India Radio stations give weather warnings). Keep monitoring the warnings. This will help you prepare for a cyclone emergency. Pass the information to others. Ignore rumours and do not spread them; this will help to avoid panic situations. Believe in the official information When a cyclone alert is on for your area continue normal working but stay alert to the radio warnings. Stay alert for the next 24 hours as a cyclone alert means that the danger is within 24 hours.   When your area is under cyclone warning get away from low-lying beaches or other low-lying areas close to the coast Leave early before your way to high ground or shelter gets flooded Do not delay and run the risk of being marooned If your house is securely built on high ground take shelter in the safe part of the house. However, if asked to evacuate do not hesitate to leave the place. Board up glass windows or put storm shutters in place. Provide strong suitable support for outside doors. If you do not have wooden boards handy, paste paper strips on glasses to prevent splinters. However, this may not avoid breaking windows. Get extra food, which can be eaten without cooking. Store extra drinking water in suitably covered vessels. If you have to evacuate the house move your valuable articles to upper floors to minimize flood damage. Ensure that your hurricane lantern, torches or other emergency lights are in working condition and keep them handy. Small and loose things, which can fly in strong winds, should be stored safely in a room. Be sure that a window and door can be opened only on the side opposite to the one facing the wind. Make provision for children and adults requiring special diet. If the centre of the cyclone is passing directly over your house there will be a lull in the wind and rain lasting for half an hour or so. During this time do not go out; because immediately after that, very strong winds will blow from the opposite direction. Switch off the electrical mains in your house. Remain calm. When Evacuation is instructed Pack essentials for yourself and your family to last a few days. These should include medicines, special food for babies and children or elders. Head for the proper shelter or evacuation points indicated for your area. Do not worry about your property At the shelter follow instructions of the person in charge. Remain in the shelter until you are informed to leave Post-cyclone measures You should remain in the shelter until informed that you can return to your home. You must get inoculated against diseases immediately. Strictly avoid any loose and dangling wires from lamp posts. If you have to drive, do drive carefully. Clear debris from your premises immediately. Report the correct losses to appropriate authorities.     Last Updated on Wednesday, 08 April 2015 13:25 Disclaimer Terms of Use Site Map Policies Help RTI Contact Us Emergency Response Website maintained by Mphasis .

Urban Floods Information Do\'s and Dont\'s Recover and Build Emergency Kit Guidelines Projects and Schemes Do\'s and Dont\'s Before floods Do not litter waste, plastic bags, plastic bottles in drains Try to be at home if high tide and heavy rains occur simultaneously Listen to weather forecast at All India Radio, Doordarshan. Also, messages by Municipal bodies from time to time and act accordingly. Evacuate low lying areas and shift to safer places. Make sure that each person has lantern, torch, some edibles, drinking water, dry clothes and necessary documents while evacuating or shifting. Make sure that each family member has identity card. Put all valuables at a higher place in the house. In the Flood Situation Obey orders by government and shift to a safer place. Be at safe place and they try to collect correct information. Switch of electrical supply and don’t touch open wires. Don’t get carried away by rumors and don not spread rumors. DO\'s Switch off electrical and gas appliances, and turn off services off at the mains. Carry your emergency kit and let your friends and family know where you are going. Avoid contact with flood water it may be contaminated with sewage,oil,chemicals or other substances. If you have to walk in standing water, use a pole or stick to ensure that you do not step into deep water, open manholes or ditches. Stay away from power lines electrical current can travel through water, Report power lines that are down to the power company. Look before you step-after a flood, the ground and floors are covered with debris, which may include broken bottles, sharp objects, nails etc.Floors and stairs covered with mud and debris can be slippery. Listen to the radio or television for updates and information. If the ceiling is wet shut off electricity. Place a bucket underneath the spot and poke a small hole into the ceiling to relieve the pressure. Use buckets,clean towels and mops to remove as much of the water from the afflicted rooms as possible. Place sheets of aluminium foil between furniture wet carpet.   Don\'t\'s Don\'t walk through flowing water - currents can be deceptive, and shallow, fast moving water can knock you off your feet. Don\'t swim through fast flowing water - you may get swept away or struck by an object in the water. Don\'t drive through a flooded area - You may not be able to see abrupt drop - offs and only half a meter of flood water can carry a car away. Driving through flood water can also cause additional damage to nearby property. Don\'t eat any food that has come into contact with flood water. Don\'t reconnect your power supply until a qualified engineer has checked it. Be alert for gas leaks - do not smoke or use candles, lanterns, or open flames. Don\'t scrub or brush mud and other deposits from materials, This may cause further damage. Never turn on ceiling fixtures if ceiling is wet. Stay away from ceilings those are sagging. Never use TVs, VCRS, CRT terminals or other electrical equipment while standing on wet floors, especially concrete. Don\'t attempt to remove standing water using your vacuum cleaner. Don\'t remove standing water in a basement too fast. If the pressure is relieved too quickly it may put undue stress on the walls.
